   40 |     I'll focus on capturing the core invariants that maintain the list's integrity during reversal. The key is to ensure pointer relationships remain consistent and no memory is lost during the transformation. Tracking the state of pointers and their connections becomes crucial in verifying the list manipulation's correctness.;
