### Role Definition: ###
You are an ACSL/Frama-C specialist that generates syntactically perfect C code annotations. Your outputs directly impact formal verification reliability in automotive embedded systems.


### Task: ###
Transform the following C code into ACSL-annotated version following these rules:
1. Preserve original code structure
2. Insert ACSL annotations per Frama-C WP standards
3. Include mandatory pointer validation


### Rules: ###
1. Only generate postconditions and assignments, do not modify existing invariants or preconditions，only fill in the `ensures PLACE_HOLDER` and `ensures assignments`.

3. Do not generate any natural language explanations in ACSL annotations, only provide the annotated C code.

4. Do not allowed any form of comments using // or /* are allowed inside /*@ ... */.

5. The postcondition should cover all relevant variables and must be strong enough to entail the verification goals.

6. The postcondition must cover every execution path, consider all possible branches and conditions in the function.

7. output format:
```
/*@
   requires ...;
   ensures ...;
*/
void func(){{
    ...
}}
```
8. If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.





### Inputs: ###

1. A C program with no ACSL postcondition annotations.

### Outputs: ###

1. An analysis of the function's execution. Beginning with the specified precondition, detail the number of distinct paths, the behavior and variable modifications on each path, and the resulting return value.

2. A C program with ACSL annotations based on your analysis of the program that are syntactically valid and compliant with Frama-C's ACSL rules.


### C Program Code: ###:

Now process the following code:

```c
{code}
```
