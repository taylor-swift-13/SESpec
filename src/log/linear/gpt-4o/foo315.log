#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose:** The loop increments three variables `i`, `j`, and `k` by 3 until `i` reaches or exceeds `n`. The intended outcome is to ensure that all three variables are increased in tandem, maintaining equality among them.
  
- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while (i < n)` — the loop continues executing as long as `i` is less than `n`.
  - **Operations Performed:** Inside the loop, the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 3: `i = i + 3; j = j + 3; k = k + 3;`.
  - **Relevant Variables:** `i`, `j`, and `k` are all relevant to the loop's behavior as they are modified within the loop body.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:** Before the loop begins, the values are:
  - `i = 0`
  - `j = 0`
  - `k = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **Iteration 1:** 
    - `i = 3`
    - `j = 3`
    - `k = 3`
  - **Iteration 2:** 
    - `i = 6`
    - `j = 6`
    - `k = 6`
  - **Iteration 3:** 
    - `i = 9`
    - `j = 9`
    - `k = 9`
  - **Iteration 4:** 
    - `i = 12`
    - `j = 12`
    - `k = 12`
  - **Iteration 5:** 
    - `i = 15`
    - `j = 15`
    - `k = 15`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:** If `n = 15`, the loop terminates after the fifth iteration:
  - `i = 18`
  - `j = 18`
  - `k = 18`

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal:** The post-condition is `k == j`.

- **Analysis:**
  - **Can it serve as part of the loop invariant?** Yes, the goal `k == j` can be directly used as an invariant component because it is maintained throughout the loop iterations.
  - **Establishment:** The condition `k == j` holds before the loop starts since both are initialized to 0.
  - **Preservation:** As both `k` and `j` are incremented by the same amount (3) in each iteration, the equality `k == j` is preserved.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, the condition `k == j` still holds true.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `k == j` and `i == j` and `i == k`

- **Explanation:** 
  - The invariant `k == j` is valid because both variables are incremented equally throughout the loop.
  - The invariant `i == j` and `i == k` is valid for the same reason, as all three variables are incremented equally.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Invariant Establishment:** 
  - Before the loop begins, `i`, `j`, and `k` are all initialized to 0, satisfying the invariant `k == j`, `i == j`, and `i == k`.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Invariant Preservation:** 
  - If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (`i == j == k`), then after incrementing each by 3, it remains true (`i + 3 == j + 3 == k + 3`).

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **Termination Conditions:** 
  - The loop terminates when `i >= n`. At this point, `j` and `k` have been incremented equally, maintaining `k == j`.
  - The invariant `k == j`, `i == j`, and `i == k` remains valid under termination conditions.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Post-condition Evaluation:** 
  - The post-condition `k == j` is correct.
  - The invariant `k == j`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`i >= n`), ensures the post-condition is met upon loop termination.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.
