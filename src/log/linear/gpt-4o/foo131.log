2025-12-22 16:34:02,669 - INFO  - think in natural language: To perform a loop verification analysis on the given C code snippet, we will follow the structured sections outlined in the task. Let's start with the analysis:

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  The loop's purpose is to decrement the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively, as long as `x1` is greater than 0 and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The intended outcome is to reduce these variables until the loop condition `x1 > 0` becomes false, at which point the loop terminates.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while(x1 > 0)`
  - **Operations in Body:** 
    - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, decrement `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`.
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `d1`, `d2`, `d3`

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x1 = 1`, `x2 = x2`, `x3 = x3`, `d1 = 1`, `d2 = 1`, `d3 = 1`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **Iteration 1:** 
    - Assuming `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, the values will be: `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2 - 1`, `x3 = x3 - 1`
  - **Iteration 2:** 
    - The loop terminates because `x1 = 0`. No further iterations occur.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - The loop exits after the first iteration with `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2 - 1`, `x3 = x3 - 1`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `x3 >= 0`

- **Analysis:**
  - The verification goal `x3 >= 0` can be part of the loop invariant because it is expected to be maintained throughout the loop execution.
  - **Establishment:** Initially, `x3` is assumed to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
  - **Preservation:** During each iteration, `x3` is decremented by 1, but it remains non-negative as long as the loop executes.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x3` should still be non-negative because it was decremented by 1 only once, and it started as positive.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:**
  - "At the start and end of each iteration, `x3 >= 0` and `x1 >= 0`."

- **Explanation:**
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - **Establishment:** Before the loop begins, `x3` is positive and `x1` is initialized to 1.
    - **Preservation:** During the loop, `x3` is decremented only if it is positive, ensuring it remains non-negative.
    - **Termination:** When `x1` becomes 0, the loop exits, and `x3` remains non-negative.

### e. Establishment

- **Explanation:**
  - The invariant is established because `x3` is assumed to be positive before the loop begins, and `x1` is initialized to 1, which is non-negative.

### f. Preservation

- **Explanation:**
  - If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`x3 >= 0` and `x1 >= 0`), the operations within the loop preserve this invariant:
    - `x3` is decremented only if it is positive, ensuring it remains non-negative.
    - `x1` is decremented, but the loop only executes while `x1 > 0`, preserving non-negativity.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State:**
  - When the loop terminates, `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2 - 1`, `x3 = x3 - 1`.
  
- **Invariant Validity:**
  - The invariant remains valid because the loop exits when `x1 = 0`, and `x3` is still non-negative.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation:**
  - The post-condition `x3 >= 0` is correct.
  
- **Explanation:**
  - The invariant `x3 >= 0`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`), ensures that the post-condition is met. The loop only decrements `x3` if it is positive, and when the loop exits, `x3` remains non-negative.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 16:34:02,697 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo131(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop in the function `foo131` is designed to decrement the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively, under the condition that both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The loop continues until `x1` is no longer greater than zero. The intended outcome is to reduce `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` simultaneously until either `x1` becomes zero or negative, or the conditions on `x2` and `x3` prevent further decrements.

**Structure:**

- **Governing Condition:** `while(x1 > 0)`
- **Operations Performed:**
  - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, the following operations are performed:
    - `x1 = x1 - d1;`
    - `x2 = x2 - d2;`
    - `x3 = x3 - d3;`
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x1`: Governs the loop continuation.
  - `x2`, `x3`: Conditions for decrement operations.
  - `d1`, `d2`, `d3`: Constants used for decrementing.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**

- `x1 = 1`
- `x2 = (input value)`
- `x3 = (input value)`
- `d1 = 1`
- `d2 = 1`
- `d3 = 1`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**

Assuming initial values where `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`:

- **After Iteration 1:**
  - `x1 = 0`
  - `x2 = x2 - 1`
  - `x3 = x3 - 1`

- **After Iteration 2:**
  - The loop exits after the first iteration because `x1` is no longer greater than zero.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**

- `x1 <= 0`
- `x2 = (initial x2) - 1`
- `x3 = (initial x3) - 1`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `x3 >= 0`

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **No:** The verification goal `x3 >= 0` is not suitable as a loop invariant because it is only guaranteed at termination, not necessarily during each iteration. During the loop, `x3` can be positive and is being decremented, which does not guarantee it remains non-negative.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**
  - A suitable invariant could be: `x3 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x1 >= 0`
  - **Establishment:** This invariant holds before the first iteration as all variables are initialized to positive values.
  - **Preservation:** If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, it will continue to hold after the iteration, as long as the loop condition is true.
  - **Termination:** The invariant, combined with `x1 <= 0`, implies `x3 >= 0`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**

In natural language: "During each iteration of the loop, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` remain non-negative."

**Explanation:**

- The invariant `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` is valid because:
  - It is established before the loop starts.
  - It is preserved through each iteration where `x1 > 0` and both `x2` and `x3` are positive.
  - Upon termination, the invariant ensures `x3` is non-negative.

### e. Establishment

**Explanation:**

- The invariant `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` is established initially because:
  - `x1` is initialized to 1, and both `x2` and `x3` are assumed positive based on the conditions within the loop.
  - Thus, all three variables are non-negative before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**Explanation:**

- If `x1 > 0`, `x2 > 0`, and `x3 > 0` at the start of an iteration, then:
  - After decrementing, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` remain non-negative.
  - The loop invariant is preserved as the loop only decrements the variables when they are positive.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State at Termination:**

- `x1 <= 0` indicates loop termination.
- `x2` and `x3` are non-negative due to the invariant.

**Explanation:**

- When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0` ensures the loop invariant `x3 >= 0` holds, as `x3` was decremented from a positive value.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation:**

- The post-condition `x3 >= 0` is correct.

**Explanation:**

- The invariant `x3 >= 0`, combined with `x1 <= 0` (negation of the loop condition), ensures that `x3` is non-negative upon loop termination, satisfying the post-condition.

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The purpose of the loop is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, respectively, as long as `x1` is greater than 0 and both `x2` and `x3` are greater than 0. The loop effectively reduces these values to ensure that `x3` becomes non-positive by the end, satisfying the post-condition `x3 >= 0`.

- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while(x1 > 0)`
  - **Operations**: 
    - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, the loop body executes, decrementing `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `d1`, `d2`, `d3`

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - Initial values: `x1 = 1`, `x2 = x2`, `x3 = x3`, `d1 = 1`, `d2 = 1`, `d3 = 1`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: 
    - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, then: `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2 - 1`, `x3 = x3 - 1`
  - **Iteration 2**: 
    - If `x2 > 1` and `x3 > 1`, then: `x1 = -1`, `x2 = x2 - 2`, `x3 = x3 - 2`
  - **Iteration 3**: 
    - If `x2 > 2` and `x3 > 2`, then: `x1 = -2`, `x2 = x2 - 3`, `x3 = x3 - 3`
  - **Iteration 4**: 
    - If `x2 > 3` and `x3 > 3`, then: `x1 = -3`, `x2 = x2 - 4`, `x3 = x3 - 4`
  - **Iteration 5**: 
    - If `x2 > 4` and `x3 > 4`, then: `x1 = -4`, `x2 = x2 - 5`, `x3 = x3 - 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - The loop terminates when `x1 <= 0` or either `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition `x3 >= 0` needs to be proven.

- **Can the Verification Goal be used as an Invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The post-condition `x3 >= 0` cannot be directly used as an invariant because it is not guaranteed to be true during every iteration of the loop. It is only guaranteed at termination.

- **Modified Invariant**:
  - **Proposal**: A valid loop invariant could be `x3 >= x1`.
  - **Establishment**: Initially, `x3 >= x1` is true because both are initialized to 1.
  - **Preservation**: If `x3 >= x1` holds at the start of an iteration and the loop executes, `x3` and `x1` are both decremented by 1, maintaining `x3 >= x1`.
  - **Termination**: When the loop terminates (`x1 <= 0`), `x3 >= 0` follows from `x3 >= x1`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Invariant**: `x3 >= x1`
- **Explanation**: 
  - The invariant `x3 >= x1` is valid because it holds true before the loop starts and is preserved through each iteration. When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0` ensures `x3 >= 0`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Explanation**: 
  - Before the loop begins, `x1 = 1` and `x3 = x3`. If `x3 >= 1`, then `x3 >= x1` is established.
  - The pre-condition guarantees that the invariant holds true before the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation

- **Explanation**: 
  - If `x3 >= x1` is true at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true, both `x3` and `x1` are decremented by the same amount (1), preserving `x3 >= x1`.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when `x1 <= 0`.
- **State of Variables**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0` implies `x3 >= 0` due to the invariant `x3 >= x1`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation**: The post-condition `x3 >= 0` is correct.
- **Explanation**: 
  - The invariant `x3 >= x1` combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`) ensures that `x3 >= 0` is met, proving the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 17:09:52,197 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Loop Verification Analysis for `foo131` Function ###

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The loop is designed to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively, as long as `x1` is greater than 0, and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The loop continues to execute until `x1` is no longer positive. The intended outcome is that `x1` becomes non-positive, while `x2` and `x3` decrease by the same amount if their initial values were positive.

- **Structure**: 
  - **Governing Condition**: `while(x1 > 0)`
  - **Operations in the Body**: 
    - Check if `x2 > 0`
    - If `x2 > 0`, check if `x3 > 0`
    - If both conditions are true, decrement `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `d1`, `d2`, `d3`

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - Initial values: `x1 = 1`, `x2 = x2_initial`, `x3 = x3_initial`, `d1 = 1`, `d2 = 1`, `d3 = 1`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: 
    - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2_initial - 1`, `x3 = x3_initial - 1`
  - **Iteration 2**: 
    - If the loop continues (i.e., if `x1 > 0` and both `x2_initial > 1` and `x3_initial > 1`), `x1 = -1`, `x2 = x2_initial - 2`, `x3 = x3_initial - 2`
  - **Iteration 3**: 
    - `x1 = -2`, `x2 = x2_initial - 3`, `x3 = x3_initial - 3`
  - **Iteration 4**: 
    - `x1 = -3`, `x2 = x2_initial - 4`, `x3 = x3_initial - 4`
  - **Iteration 5**: 
    - `x1 = -4`, `x2 = x2_initial - 5`, `x3 = x3_initial - 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - The loop terminates when `x1 <= 0`. Depending on initial values of `x2` and `x3`, the loop may terminate earlier than five iterations if `x2` or `x3` become non-positive.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal**: `x3 >= 0`
- **Analysis**:
  - The verification goal `x3 >= 0` cannot directly serve as a loop invariant because during the iterations, `x3` is decremented and may become negative if `x3_initial` is not sufficiently large.
  - To modify the goal into a valid invariant, consider the invariant: `x1 > 0 => x3 > 0`. This invariant establishes that while `x1` is positive, `x3` must remain positive.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: 
  - In natural language: "If `x1` is positive, then both `x2` and `x3` are positive."
  - Detailed Explanation: This invariant holds because the loop only decrements `x2` and `x3` if both are initially positive and `x1` is positive. Therefore, if the loop executes, `x3` must remain positive until `x1` becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Establishment Explanation**: 
  - Before the loop starts, `x1` is initialized to 1, which is positive, ensuring that the invariant holds if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Preservation Explanation**: 
  - If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`x1 > 0` implies `x3 > 0`), and the loop condition is true (`x1 > 0`), then `x3` is decremented only if it is positive, maintaining the invariant for the next iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **Termination State**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0`. At this point, the invariant does not need to hold (`x1 > 0 => x3 > 0` is vacuously true if `x1 <= 0`).
- **Invariant Validity**: 
  - At termination, the invariant no longer applies, but `x3 >= 0` is ensured by the loop's logic and termination condition.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Evaluation**: 
  - The post-condition `x3 >= 0` is correct.
- **Explanation**: 
  - The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`), ensures that `x3` is non-negative at the end of the loop. If `x1` becomes non-positive, the loop exits, and the condition `x3 >= 0` holds because the loop would not decrement `x3` below zero unless it started above zero.

2025-12-22 17:09:52,239 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

2025-12-22 17:21:33,600 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Loop Verification Analysis

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  The purpose of the loop is to decrement the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively, as long as `x1` is greater than 0 and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The loop aims to reduce these variables until either `x1` becomes non-positive or the conditions on `x2` and `x3` prevent further execution.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while(x1 > 0)`
  - **Operations:** Inside the loop, the code checks if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`. If both conditions are true, it decrements `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`.
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `d1`, `d2`, `d3`

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = x2` (initial value passed to the function)
  - `x3 = x3` (initial value passed to the function)
  - `d1 = 1`, `d2 = 1`, `d3 = 1`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  Assuming `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` initially:
  - **Iteration 1:** 
    - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2 - 1`, `x3 = x3 - 1`
  - **Iteration 2:** 
    - The loop exits because `x1` is now 0, which does not satisfy the loop condition `x1 > 0`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = x2 - 1`, `x3 = x3 - 1` (assuming the loop terminated after the first iteration)

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** `assert x3 >= 0;`
- **Can it serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal `x3 >= 0` is only guaranteed after the loop terminates, not during each iteration. During iterations, `x3` could potentially become negative if its initial value is less than or equal to 0.
- **Modification to Create a Valid Invariant:**
  - A suitable invariant could be `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`, which ensures all variables remain non-negative.
  - **Establishment:** Initially, `x1 = 1`, and if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, the invariant holds true.
  - **Preservation:** If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, it remains true after the iteration as each variable is decremented by 1.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0` implies the post-condition `x3 >= 0` if the invariant is `x3 >= 0`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`
- **Explanation:**
  - This invariant is valid because it ensures that all relevant variables remain non-negative throughout the loop's execution. It captures the essence of the loop's operation: decrementing variables while maintaining non-negativity.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment Explanation:**
  - Before the loop starts, `x1 = 1`, which satisfies `x1 >= 0`. If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, the invariant holds as both `x2` and `x3` are initially positive.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation Explanation:**
  - If `x1 >= 0`, `x2 >= 0`, and `x3 >= 0` at the start of an iteration, decrementing each by 1 keeps them non-negative as long as the loop condition `x1 > 0` is true. The invariant holds because the loop only executes if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State:**
  - When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0` because the loop condition `x1 > 0` becomes false.
  - **Invariant Validity:** The invariant remains valid as `x1 >= 0` is no longer needed, and `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` ensure `x3 >= 0`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation:**
  - The post-condition `x3 >= 0` is correct.
  - **Proof:** The invariant `x3 >= 0`, combined with the termination condition `x1 <= 0`, ensures that `x3` is non-negative when the loop exits, satisfying the post-condition.

2025-12-22 17:21:33,630 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`
