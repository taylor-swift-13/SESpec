2025-12-22 15:45:23,126 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The loop aims to ensure that the variable `x` becomes equal to `y`. The loop's body contains conditional logic that can modify `y` and set a `lock` variable. The intended outcome is that the loop will exit when `x` is equal to `y`, and the `lock` variable should be `1` at the end.

- **Loop Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (x != y)`. The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to `y`.
  - **Operations Performed**:
    - If `unknown()` returns true, `lock` is set to `1`, and `x` is set to `y`.
    - If `unknown()` returns false, `lock` is set to `0`, `x` is set to `y`, and `y` is incremented by `1`.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x`, `y`, and `lock`.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - `x = y`, `lock = 1`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling** (assuming `unknown()` alternates between true and false):
  1. **Iteration 1**: If `unknown()` is true, `x = y`, `lock = 1`. If false, `x = y`, `y = y + 1`, `lock = 0`.
  2. **Iteration 2**: If `unknown()` is true, `x = y`, `lock = 1`. If false, `x = y`, `y = y + 1`, `lock = 0`.
  3. **Iteration 3**: If `unknown()` is true, `x = y`, `lock = 1`. If false, `x = y`, `y = y + 1`, `lock = 0`.
  4. **Iteration 4**: If `unknown()` is true, `x = y`, `lock = 1`. If false, `x = y`, `y = y + 1`, `lock = 0`.
  5. **Iteration 5**: If `unknown()` is true, `x = y`, `lock = 1`. If false, `x = y`, `y = y + 1`, `lock = 0`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: The loop exits when `x == y`, and `lock` should be `1`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**: `assert lock == 1;`

- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot directly serve as an invariant because `lock` may be set to `0` during the loop iterations if `unknown()` returns false.

- **Modification for a Valid Invariant**:
  - **Invariant Proposal**: "If `x == y`, then `lock == 1`."
  - **Establishment**: Initially, `x == y`, and `lock == 1`.
  - **Preservation**: If `x == y` and `lock == 1` at the start of an iteration, the operations within the loop will not change this fact.
  - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x == y`, and thus `lock == 1` is ensured.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: "If `x == y`, then `lock == 1`."

- **Explanation**: 
  - This invariant captures the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `lock`. It ensures that when `x` is equal to `y`, `lock` is always `1`, which aligns with the post-condition requirement.

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment Explanation**:
  - Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to `y`, and `lock` is set to `1`. Therefore, the invariant "If `x == y`, then `lock == 1`" holds true.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation Explanation**:
  - During each iteration, if `x == y` at the start, then `lock` remains `1` since either `unknown()` is true, or `x` and `y` are modified such that `x` remains equal to `y`.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State**:
  - The loop terminates when `x == y`.
  - At termination, the invariant "If `x == y`, then `lock == 1`" ensures that `lock` is `1`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation**:
  - The post-condition `assert lock == 1;` is correct.
  - The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x == y`), implies the post-condition is met. When the loop exits, `x == y`, and the invariant ensures `lock == 1`.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 15:45:23,149 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == \at(y,Pre)) * (lock == 1) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `


int foo87(int y) {

    int lock = 1;
