2025-12-22 16:56:34,913 - INFO  - think in natural language: To perform a comprehensive loop verification analysis on the given C code snippet, we will follow the structured sections outlined in the task description.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop's purpose is to modify the values of variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions until an unspecified condition (`unknown()`) becomes false. The operations within the loop depend on the values of these variables, particularly `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues while `unknown()` returns true. Since `unknown()` is not defined, we cannot predict when the loop will terminate.
- **Operations:**
  - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
  - Otherwise, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  - Increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10 in every iteration.
- **Variables:** `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` are modified in each iteration based on the conditions.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
Assuming `unknown()` remains true for at least five iterations, we sample after each iteration:

1. **Iteration 1:**
   - `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1` (else condition executed).

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2` (else condition executed).

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3` (else condition executed).

4. **Iteration 4:**
   - `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4` (else condition executed).

5. **Iteration 5:**
   - `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5` (`x >= 4` condition executed).

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- Since `unknown()` is not defined, we cannot predict when the loop will terminate or sample post-loop values.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
- `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`

**Analysis:**
- **Can the verification goal be used as an invariant?** No, because the post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is not necessarily true during the loop execution. It specifically applies at termination when `unknown()` is false.
- **Modification for Invariant:** To create a valid invariant, we could consider the condition `x < 4` whenever `y <= 2` as part of the invariant during iterations. However, `y` is often much larger than 2, except when negated.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- At the start and end of each iteration, `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `z >= 10 * w`, and `w >= 0`.

**Explanation:**
- **Validity:** This invariant holds because:
  - `x` is always incremented by at least 1.
  - `y` is either incremented positively or negated (resulting in non-positive values only when negated).
  - `z` is incremented by 10, which ensures `z >= 10 * w` since both `z` and `w` are incremented by fixed amounts.
  - `w` is always incremented by 1, ensuring it remains non-negative.

### e. Establishment

**Invariant Establishment:**
- **Pre-condition:** Initially, `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.
- **Establishment:** Before the first iteration, `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `z = 0 >= 10 * 0`, and `w >= 0` are trivially true.

### f. Preservation

**Invariant Preservation:**
- **During Iteration:** If `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `z >= 10 * w`, and `w >= 0` hold at the start of an iteration, they continue to hold at the end:
  - `x` is incremented, maintaining `x >= 0`.
  - `y` may be negated but still satisfies `y >= 0` at iteration end due to the operations performed.
  - `z` is incremented by 10, maintaining `z >= 10 * w` as both `z` and `w` are incremented.
  - `w` is incremented, maintaining `w >= 0`.

### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination State:**
- When `unknown()` becomes false, the invariant `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `z >= 10 * w`, and `w >= 0` still holds.

**Invariant Validity at Termination:**
- The invariant holds under termination conditions as it does not depend on `unknown()` but on the operations performed.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition Evaluation:**
- The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is correct under the assumption that the loop terminates with `y <= 2`, which would imply `x < 4` given the loop logic.

**Proof with Invariant:**
- The invariant `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `z >= 10 * w`, and `w >= 0`, combined with `unknown()` being false, does not directly imply the post-condition. However, if `y <= 2` at termination, the operations ensure `x < 4` due to the loop structure, satisfying the post-condition.

In conclusion, the loop invariant ensures non-negative progression of variables, and the post-condition correctness depends on the specific values at termination, particularly `y <= 2`.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 16:56:34,989 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo188() {

2025-12-22 16:57:09,530 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `y >= 0` fails to be preserved across iterations. This is because the operation `y = 0 - y;` can make `y` negative, violating the invariant. Therefore, this invariant is incorrect and needs to be removed or replaced with a condition that holds true after each loop iteration.

2. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` fails because the existing invariants do not guarantee that this condition will hold after the loop terminates. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that when `y <= 2`, it implies `x < 4` upon loop termination.

### Fixed C Code:

2025-12-22 17:11:23,698 - INFO  - think in natural language: To perform a comprehensive loop verification analysis of the given C code snippet, we will proceed through the structured sections as outlined.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop appears to perform operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions involving these variables. The intended outcome seems to be to increment these variables in specific ways until the `unknown()` function returns false, at which point the loop terminates.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations:**
  - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  - Else if `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
  - Else, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  - Always increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10.
- **Relevant Variables:** `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
Assuming `unknown()` continues to return true, we will sample after each iteration:

1. **Iteration 1:**
   - `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1` (assuming the third condition `else` executes).

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2` (assuming the third condition `else` executes).

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3` (assuming the third condition `else` executes).

4. **Iteration 4:**
   - `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4` (assuming the third condition `else` executes).

5. **Iteration 5:**
   - `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5` (assuming the first condition `if x >= 4` executes).

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
This sampling is contingent upon `unknown()` returning false after the fifth iteration. The values would be `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
- The post-condition is: `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`

**Analysis:**
- **Can the verification goal be part of the invariant?** No, because the condition `(y <= 2)` is not true during most iterations, especially when `y` is incremented significantly.
- **Modification Proposal:** A possible invariant could involve relationships between `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` that reflect their growth rates and conditions.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
In natural language: "Throughout the loop, the variables maintain a consistent relationship: `y` is incremented based on the value of `x` and specific conditions, `z` grows consistently with `w`, and `x` is incremented based on the conditions evaluated."

**Explanation:**
- This invariant reflects the behavior observed in the iterations, ensuring the relationships between `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are maintained.

### e. Establishment

**Invariant Establishment:**
- Initially, all variables are zero, which trivially satisfies the invariant as there are no conflicting conditions.
- The pre-condition of zero values ensures the invariant holds before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**Invariant Preservation:**
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, the operations within the loop body (conditional increments) maintain these relationships.
- Each conditional branch results in changes that are consistent with the invariant's description.

### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination State:**
- When `unknown()` returns false, the loop exits, leaving the variables in a state that satisfies the invariant.
- The invariant remains valid under these conditions because it describes the relationships maintained throughout the loop.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is not generally correct throughout the loop execution. The invariant does not directly imply this post-condition due to the growth of `y`.
- The invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition (`unknown() == false`) does not directly prove the post-condition.

Overall, the invariant focuses on maintaining consistent relationships between variables throughout the loop, rather than directly proving the given post-condition. Adjustments to the loop structure or post-condition may be necessary for a direct proof.

2025-12-22 17:11:23,725 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

    int x;

2025-12-22 17:11:59,247 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `y >= 0` fails because the operation `y = 0 - y;` can make `y` negative, violating the invariant. Therefore, the invariant `y >= 0` is not preserved through the loop iterations.

2. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` cannot be verified because the loop operations can increment `y` significantly, making the condition `y <= 2` unlikely to hold, especially after many iterations. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure the postcondition can be derived from the invariant and the negation of the loop condition.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;
    w = 0;

2025-12-22 17:25:15,767 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Loop Verification Analysis

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The loop appears to perform iterative operations on four variables: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The loop's purpose is not explicitly stated, but it seems to manipulate these variables based on certain conditions involving their values. The goal is likely to adjust these variables until a condition outside the loop is met.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop is controlled by the condition `while(unknown())`. Since `unknown()` is a placeholder for a function, we cannot determine when the loop will terminate. It suggests that the loop's termination depends on external or undefined conditions.
- **Operations:** Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:
  - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, set `y` to `-y`.
  - Otherwise, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  - Increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10.
- **Variables:** The loop modifies the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, which are initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop begins, the values are: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
- **Iteration 1:** Assuming `unknown()` returns true, the loop starts.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1` (since `x < 4` initially).
- **Iteration 2:** 
  - `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2` (since `x < 4`).
- **Iteration 3:** 
  - `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3` (since `x < 4`).
- **Iteration 4:** 
  - `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4` (since `x < 4`).
- **Iteration 5:** 
  - `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5` (since `x >= 4`).

**Post-Loop Sampling:** Without the definition of `unknown()`, we cannot predict when the loop will terminate, but it could continue indefinitely or stop based on external conditions.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
- The post-condition to be proven is: `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`

**Analysis:**
- **Can the verification goal be used as an invariant?**
  - **NO:** The goal `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` cannot be directly used as an invariant because during the loop iterations, `y` often exceeds 2, making the implication irrelevant during the loop.

**Modifications for Invariant:**
- The invariant can be modified to consider the relationship between `x` and `y` as the loop progresses. A suitable invariant might involve constraints on `x` and `y` that hold throughout the loop.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- In natural language: "If `x < 4`, then `y` increases by 100 each iteration; if `x >= 4`, `y` increases by 2 each iteration."
- Explanation: This invariant describes the behavior of `x` and `y` based on the conditions within the loop. It reflects the expected increase in `y` relative to `x`'s value.

#### e. Establishment

**Invariant Establishment:**
- The invariant holds before the first iteration because initially, `x = 0`, `y = 0`, which means `x < 4`, and thus `y` increases by 100 in the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation

**Invariant Preservation:**
- The invariant is preserved through each iteration because:
  - If `x < 4`, `y` is increased by 100.
  - If `x >= 4`, `y` is increased by 2.
- These operations maintain the invariant structure.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination Conditions:**
- Upon termination (when `unknown()` becomes false), the loop invariant still holds as the conditions inside the loop are consistently applied. The invariant does not directly imply the post-condition, but it ensures the behavior of `x` and `y` is consistent.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is correct only under specific conditions when `y` is small, but the invariant itself does not guarantee this.
- The invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition doesn't directly prove the post-condition due to the nature of `unknown()`. However, the loop's structure ensures that if `y` is ever less than or equal to 2, `x` would be less than 4, aligning with the post-condition.

2025-12-22 17:25:15,795 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;

    w = 0;

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `

2025-12-22 17:25:50,810 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**

The invariant `y >= 0` fails to be preserved across iterations because the operation `y = 0 - y` can make `y` negative. This operation occurs when `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, which means the invariant `y >= 0` is not preserved under certain conditions.

**Error 2: Goal Assertion**

The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` cannot be verified because the invariant does not sufficiently constrain `x` and `y` to imply this assertion when the loop terminates. We need a stronger invariant that maintains a relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop.

### Fixed C Code

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The loop's purpose is to perform a series of operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions. The intended outcome is to modify these variables until the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false. The operations seem to be adjusting the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` according to specific conditions, potentially simulating some form of iterative calculation or state transition.

- **Structure**: 
  - **Governing Condition**: The loop runs while `unknown()` returns true. Since `unknown()` is a placeholder for a condition, we don't have explicit control over the loop's termination from the code snippet alone.
  - **Operations**: 
    - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
    - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
    - Otherwise, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
    - Increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10 each iteration.
  - **Variables**: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are relevant to the loop's behavior.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: Before the loop starts, all variables are initialized to 0: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: Assume `unknown()` is true.
    - Since `x < 4`, execute the else clause: `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `w = 1`, `z = 10`.
  - **Iteration 2**: Assume `unknown()` is true.
    - Since `x < 4`, execute the else clause: `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `w = 2`, `z = 20`.
  - **Iteration 3**: Assume `unknown()` is true.
    - Since `x < 4`, execute the else clause: `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `w = 3`, `z = 30`.
  - **Iteration 4**: Assume `unknown()` is true.
    - Since `x < 4`, execute the else clause: `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `w = 4`, `z = 40`.
  - **Iteration 5**: Assume `unknown()` is true.
    - Now `x >= 4`, execute the first clause: `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `w = 5`, `z = 50`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: Without a specific condition for `unknown()`, we assume it remains true. Thus, sampling is based on assumptions, and termination cannot be definitively sampled.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition is `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`.
- **Can it be used as an invariant?**: No, because it is not necessarily true during the loop's execution. For instance, `y` can be greater than 2 during most iterations.
- **Modification Proposal**: An invariant can be constructed around the relationship between `x` and `y` and their respective changes per iteration. For example, `x < 4` implies `y` is incremented by 100, which does not align with the post-condition directly.
- **Invariant Establishment**: The invariant could be `x < 4 implies y >= 100 * x`, but this does not directly help with the post-condition.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x < 4 implies y >= 100 * x`.
- **Explanation**: This invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` during the iterations where `x < 4`. It is valid because:
  - Initially, `x = 0` and `y = 0`, satisfying the condition.
  - Each iteration where `x < 4` increments `y` by 100, maintaining the relationship `y >= 100 * x`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment Explanation**: Initially, `x = 0` and `y = 0`, which satisfies `y >= 100 * x`. Thus, the invariant holds before the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation Explanation**: If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration and `x < 4`, the else clause ensures `y` is incremented by 100, preserving `y >= 100 * x`. When `x >= 4`, the invariant does not need to hold, but the operations are consistent with the conditions.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State**: Upon termination, the invariant does not directly contribute to the post-condition. However, if `unknown()` becomes false, the loop stops, and the post-condition must be evaluated based on the final state.
- **Invariant Validity**: The invariant remains valid as it doesn't contradict the termination conditions, but it does not directly prove the post-condition.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation**: The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is correct but not directly proven by the invariant. It relies on the loop terminating in a state where `y <= 2`, which would imply `x < 4`.
- **Explanation**: The invariant helps track the relationship between `x` and `y` but does not directly prove the post-condition due to the nature of the operations and the condition `unknown()`.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 17:40:45,221 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**  
   The invariant `y >= 0` fails preservation. This indicates that the operations inside the loop may cause `y` to become negative during certain iterations. Specifically, the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` leads to `y = 0 - y`, which negates `y` and makes it potentially negative. The invariant must be adjusted to account for this behavior.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion**  
   The postcondition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` fails verification. This suggests that the invariant does not provide enough constraints to ensure the postcondition after the loop terminates. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that the relationship between `x` and `y` implied by the postcondition is maintained throughout the loop and at termination.

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The purpose of the loop is to modify the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions until the loop condition, governed by the function `unknown()`, becomes false. The loop adjusts these variables to achieve certain relational properties, specifically focusing on the relationship between `x` and `y`.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations:**
  - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
  - Otherwise, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  - Increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10 in every iteration.
- **Relevant Variables:** `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
- **Iteration 1:** 
  - Condition: `x < 4`, so `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`
- **Iteration 2:** 
  - Condition: `x < 4`, so `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`
- **Iteration 3:** 
  - Condition: `x < 4`, so `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`
- **Iteration 4:** 
  - Condition: `x < 4`, so `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`
- **Iteration 5:** 
  - Condition: `x >= 4`, so `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- This depends on the `unknown()` function. If it returns false after five iterations, the final values are `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`

- **Can it serve as an invariant?**
  - **NO:** The condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` cannot be directly used as an invariant because `y` quickly becomes much larger than 2 during iterations, and the relationship `(y <= 2)` is not preserved throughout the loop.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**
  - **Modified Invariant:** The invariant can be modified to focus on the relationship between increments of `x` and `y` relative to their initial values. For example, `x <= w` and `z == 10 * w` can be proposed as invariants, as these reflect consistent relationships maintained through the loop.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- **Invariant:** `x <= w` and `z == 10 * w`
- **Explanation:** 
  - `x <= w`: Every iteration increases both `x` and `w` by 1, ensuring `x` never exceeds `w`.
  - `z == 10 * w`: `z` is incremented by 10 in each iteration, maintaining this multiplicative relationship with `w`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment:** 
  - Initially, `x = 0` and `w = 0`, so `x <= w` holds.
  - Initially, `z = 0` and `w = 0`, so `z == 10 * w` holds.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation:** 
  - During each iteration:
    - `x` is incremented by 1, and `w` is incremented by 1, preserving `x <= w`.
    - `z` is incremented by 10, and `w` is incremented by 1, preserving `z == 10 * w`.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State:** When `unknown()` returns false, the loop terminates. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` will depend on the number of iterations completed.
- **Invariant Validity:** The invariant `x <= w` and `z == 10 * w` remains valid as these relationships are maintained regardless of the loop's termination.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition:** `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`
- **Correctness:** 
  - The invariant does not directly imply the post-condition. However, given the rapid increase of `y`, the post-condition `(y <= 2)` will likely be false, rendering the implication trivially true.
  - The invariant ensures consistent relationships between `x`, `w`, and `z`, but does not directly address `y` relative to `x`. The post-condition is trivially satisfied by the loop's structure rather than the invariant.

In summary, the loop's invariant focuses on the relationship between `x`, `w`, and `z`, which is consistently maintained throughout the loop. The post-condition involving `y` is trivially satisfied due to the operations within the loop rather than directly by the invariant.

2025-12-22 17:55:52,665 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

2025-12-22 17:57:00,625 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
The loop invariant `(y > 2) ==> (x >= 4)` fails preservation because it does not account for the behavior of `y` and `x` during all possible iterations. Specifically, the invariant does not hold when `y` is incremented by 100 in the `else` branch, nor does it capture the relationship between `y`, `x`, and other variables (`w` and `z`) consistently across iterations.

**Error 2: Goal Assertion**
The postcondition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` cannot be verified because the existing invariants do not sufficiently constrain the behavior of `y` and `x` throughout the loop execution. Strengthening the invariants to reflect the relationship between `y`, `x`, `w`, and `z` is necessary to ensure the postcondition can be implied.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;

The loop invariant `(y > 2) ==> (x >= 4)` fails preservation because it does not correctly capture the behavior of `x` and `y` across all iterations. Specifically, it does not account for scenarios where `y` is rapidly increased, which may violate the invariant.

**Error 2: Goal Assertion**
The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` cannot be verified because the existing invariants do not adequately constrain `y` and `x` throughout the loop execution. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that the post-condition can be implied when the loop terminates.

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
The invariant `(y > 2) ==> (x >= 4)` fails preservation because it does not consistently hold across all loop iterations. Specifically, when `y` is rapidly increased or negated, the invariant can be violated.

**Error 2: Goal Assertion**
The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is not verified because the existing invariants do not sufficiently constrain the relationship between `y` and `x` throughout the loop execution. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that the post-condition is implied when the loop terminates.

2025-12-22 18:05:43,017 - DEBUG  - regen reasoning
2025-12-22 18:05:43,018 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
The invariant `(y > 2) ==> (x >= 4)` fails preservation because it does not consistently hold across all loop iterations. Specifically, when `y` is rapidly increased or negated, the invariant can be violated.

**Error 2: Goal Assertion**
The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is not verified because the existing invariants do not sufficiently constrain the relationship between `y` and `x` throughout the loop execution. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that the post-condition is implied when the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
