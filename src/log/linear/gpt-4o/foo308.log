2025-12-22 19:42:10,705 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Loop Verification Analysis for the Given C Code Snippet

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of the loop is to iterate over integers from 0 to `n-1` and categorize each integer based on its divisibility by 4, 3, or 2. Specifically:
- If the integer is divisible by 4, increment `v4`.
- If not divisible by 4 but divisible by 3, increment `i`.
- If not divisible by 4 or 3 but divisible by 2, increment `j`.
- If not divisible by 4, 3, or 2, increment `k`.

The loop counts how many numbers fall into each category, storing the counts in the respective variables.

**Structure:**  
- **Loop Condition:** `while (l < n)` — The loop continues as long as `l` is less than `n`.
- **Loop Body:** The loop body consists of conditional statements to check divisibility and update the counters `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` accordingly. The variable `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- **Relevant Variables:** `l`, `v4`, `i`, `j`, `k`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
- `l = 0`, `v4 = 0`, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **Iteration 1:** `l = 1`, `v4 = 0`, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 1`.
2. **Iteration 2:** `l = 2`, `v4 = 0`, `i = 0`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`.
3. **Iteration 3:** `l = 3`, `v4 = 0`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`.
4. **Iteration 4:** `l = 4`, `v4 = 1`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`.
5. **Iteration 5:** `l = 5`, `v4 = 1`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 2`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
Assuming `n = 6` (to allow termination within 5 iterations), after the loop:
- `l = 6`, `v4 = 1`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 2`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
The post-condition is `assert (i + j + k + v4);`, which checks that the sum of all counters is non-zero.

**Can it be used as an invariant?**  
- **NO:** The verification goal is only concerned with the final sum being non-zero, which does not serve as an invariant during the loop's execution. The invariant must describe a property true throughout all iterations.

**Modification to create a valid invariant:**  
To create a valid invariant, we need to ensure that at any point during the loop execution, the sum of `i + j + k + v4` is equal to `l`, as `l` represents the number of iterations completed.

**Modified Invariant:**  
`i + j + k + v4 == l`

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
In natural language: The sum of the counts of numbers divisible by 4, 3, 2, and neither is equal to the current value of `l`.

**Explanation:**  
This invariant accurately reflects the categorization of numbers up to the current value of `l`. It ensures that the loop is correctly counting numbers and categorizing them.

#### e. Establishment

**Invariant Establishment:**  
Before the loop begins, `l = 0`, and all counters (`v4`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are initialized to 0. Thus, `i + j + k + v4 == 0`, which is equal to `l`. Therefore, the invariant holds before the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation

**Invariant Preservation:**  
Assuming the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`i + j + k + v4 == l`), during the iteration:
- Depending on `l`'s divisibility, one of the counters is incremented.
- `l` is incremented by 1.

Thus, at the end of the iteration, the updated sum of counters (`i + j + k + v4`) will equal the updated value of `l`. Therefore, the invariant is preserved.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination Conditions:**  
The loop terminates when `l` is no longer less than `n`, i.e., `l == n`. At this point, `i + j + k + v4 == l == n`.

**Invariant Validity at Termination:**  
The invariant `i + j + k + v4 == l` holds true at termination because `l` has reached `n`, and the sum of the counters accurately reflects the number of iterations.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**  
The post-condition `assert (i + j + k + v4);` is correct. Given that `l == n` at termination, and the invariant `i + j + k + v4 == l` holds, it follows that `i + j + k + v4 == n`. Since `n` is non-zero (as per the pre-condition `n <= 20000001`), the sum is non-zero, satisfying the post-condition.

Thus, the loop invariant and termination condition together imply the correctness of the post-condition.

2025-12-22 19:42:10,736 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: ``

Loop program: `

2025-12-22 19:44:10,859 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the current loop invariants are insufficient to establish, preserve, and verify the post-condition. Specifically:

1. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:** The invariant `n > 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 > 0` fails because it doesn't hold initially when `l = 0`. The initial state of all counters (`i`, `j`, `k`, `v4`) is zero, so the implication is not valid.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:** The current invariants do not ensure that the loop maintains the necessary properties through each iteration.

3. **Goal Assertion:** The assertion `assert (i + j + k + v4);` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The loop invariants need to be strengthened to ensure the post-condition can be implied.

To correct these issues, we need to redefine the loop invariants to properly establish the initial conditions, preserve them through the loop, and ensure they imply the post-condition.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires n <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo308(unsigned int n) {

    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int k;
    unsigned int v4;
    unsigned int l;

    i = 0;
    k = 0;
    j = 0;
    l = 0;
    v4 = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant 0 <= l <= n;
      loop invariant i + j + k + v4 == l;
      loop invariant n == 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 == 0;
      loop invariant n > 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 == l;
      loop assigns i, j, k, v4, l;
    */
    while (l < n) {
        if ((l % 4) == 0) {
            v4 = v4 + 1;
        }
        else if((l % 3) == 0){
            i = i + 1;
        }
        else if((l % 2) == 0){
            j = j + 1;
        }
        else{
            k = k + 1;
        }
        l = l + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (i + j + k + v4); */

}
```

This code introduces a new invariant `n == 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 == 0` to handle the initial condition where `n` could be zero. The invariant `n > 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 == l` ensures that as long as `n` is positive, the sum of the counters equals `l`, thereby preserving the property through each iteration. This strengthened set of invariants supports the verification of the post-condition.

1. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:** The invariant `n > 0 ==> l > 0` fails because it doesn't hold initially when `l = 0`. The initial state of `l` is zero, and the invariant incorrectly assumes `l` is positive when `n > 0`, which is not true before the loop starts.

2025-12-22 19:49:03,308 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the current loop invariants are insufficient to establish, preserve, and verify the post-condition. Specifically:

1. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:** The invariant `n > 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 > 0` fails because it doesn't hold initially when `l = 0`. The initial state of all counters (`i`, `j`, `k`, `v4`) is zero, so the implication is not valid. The invariant needs to be weakened to be valid under initial conditions.

2. **Goal Assertion:** The assertion `assert (i + j + k + v4 > 0);` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The loop invariants need to be strengthened to ensure the post-condition can be implied.

To correct these issues, we need to redefine the loop invariants to properly establish the initial conditions, preserve them through the loop, and ensure they imply the post-condition.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires n <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo308(unsigned int n) {

    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int k;
    unsigned int v4;
    unsigned int l;

    i = 0;
    k = 0;
    j = 0;
    l = 0;
    v4 = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant 0 <= l <= n;
      loop invariant i + j + k + v4 == l;
      loop invariant n == 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 == 0;
      loop invariant n > 0 ==> l > 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 > 0;
      loop assigns i, j, k, v4, l;
    */
    while (l < n) {
        if ((l % 4) == 0) {
            v4 = v4 + 1;
        }
        else if((l % 3) == 0){
            i = i + 1;
        }
        else if((l % 2) == 0){
            j = j + 1;
        }
        else{
            k = k + 1;
        }
        l = l + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 > 0); */

}
```

This code introduces a new invariant `n == 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 == 0` to handle the initial condition where `n` could be zero. The invariant `n > 0 ==> l > 0 ==> i + j + k + v4 > 0` ensures that once the loop has iterated at least once (`l > 0`), the sum of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `v4` is positive, thereby helping verify the post-condition. This strengthened set of invariants supports the verification of the post-condition.

2. **Goal Assertion:** The assertion `assert (i + j + k + v4 > 0);` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The loop invariants need to be strengthened to ensure the post-condition can be implied.

To correct these issues, we need to redefine the loop invariants to properly establish the initial conditions, preserve them through the loop, and ensure they imply the post-condition.

    unsigned int j;

    */
    while (l < n) {
        if ((l % 4) == 0) {
            v4 = v4 + 1;
        }

2025-12-22 19:52:08,594 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the current loop invariants are insufficient to establish, preserve, and verify the post-condition. Specifically:

1. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:** The invariant `n > 0 ==> l > 0` fails because it doesn't hold initially when `l = 0`. The initial state of `l` is zero, and the invariant incorrectly assumes `l` is positive when `n > 0`, which is not true before the loop starts. The invariant needs to be weakened to be valid under initial conditions.

2. **Goal Assertion:** The assertion `assert (i + j + k + v4 > 0);` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The loop invariants need to be strengthened to ensure the post-condition can be implied.

To correct these issues, we need to redefine the loop invariants to properly establish the initial conditions, preserve them through the loop, and ensure they imply the post-condition.

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The loop iterates over integers from `0` to `n-1`, categorizing each integer based on its divisibility by `4`, `3`, `2`, or neither. The counters `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` keep track of how many numbers fall into each category.
  
- **Structure**: 
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (l < n)` ensures the loop runs as long as `l` is less than `n`.
  - **Operations**: 
    - If `l` is divisible by `4`, increment `v4`.
    - Else if `l` is divisible by `3`, increment `i`.
    - Else if `l` is divisible by `2`, increment `j`.
    - Otherwise, increment `k`.
    - Increment `l` by `1` in each iteration.
  - **Variables**: `l` is the loop counter, `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are counters for divisibility categories.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - `l = 0`, `v4 = 0`, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: `l = 1`, `v4 = 1`, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.
  - **Iteration 2**: `l = 2`, `v4 = 1`, `i = 0`, `j = 1`, `k = 0`.
  - **Iteration 3**: `l = 3`, `v4 = 1`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 0`.
  - **Iteration 4**: `l = 4`, `v4 = 2`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 0`.
  - **Iteration 5**: `l = 5`, `v4 = 2`, `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: Not applicable within 5 iterations unless `n <= 5`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition `assert(i + j + k + v4)` aims to confirm that the sum of all counters equals `n`.

- **Analysis**:
  - The verification goal cannot be directly used as a loop invariant because it only holds true at termination when `l == n`.
  - **Modified Invariant**: 
    - The invariant can be: `i + j + k + v4 == l`, which is true during each iteration.
    - **Establishment**: Holds before the first iteration (`l = 0`, all counters are `0`).
    - **Preservation**: Adding `1` to `l` and exactly one counter maintains the equality.
    - **Termination**: At termination, `l = n`, implying `i + j + k + v4 == n`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Invariant**: `i + j + k + v4 == l`
- **Explanation**: 
  - At each iteration, exactly one of `v4`, `i`, `j`, or `k` is incremented, maintaining the sum equal to `l`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment**: Initially, `l = 0`, and all counters are `0`, so `i + j + k + v4 == 0`, establishing the invariant.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation**: 
  - If `i + j + k + v4 == l` holds at the start of an iteration, incrementing `l` and one counter ensures `i + j + k + v4 == l` remains true.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination**: When `l == n`, the loop exits. The invariant `i + j + k + v4 == l` implies `i + j + k + v4 == n`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Correctness**: The post-condition `assert(i + j + k + v4)` is correct because the invariant, combined with `l == n`, ensures `i + j + k + v4 == n`.

- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: ``

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires n <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo308(unsigned int n) {

    unsigned
    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int k;
    unsigned int v4;
    unsigned int l;

    i = 0;
    k = 0;
    j = 0;
    l = 0;
    v4 = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

            */
            while (l < n) {
       if ((l % 4) == 0) {
       v4 = v4 + 1;
      }
       else if((l % 3) == 0){
       i = i + 1;
      }
       else if((l % 2) == 0){
