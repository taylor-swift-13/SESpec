#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  The purpose of the loop is to increment two variables, `x` and `sn`, by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues executing as long as the condition `unknown()` is true. The intended outcome is to have `x` and `sn` incremented the same number of times, resulting in them being equal unless the loop never executes, in which case `sn` should be -1 according to the post-condition.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** The loop is governed by the condition `while(unknown())`, where `unknown()` is a function that returns a boolean value. The loop continues as long as this function returns true.
  - **Operations in Body:** In each iteration, the loop increments `x` by 1 (`x = x + 1`) and `sn` by 1 (`sn = sn + 1`).
  - **Relevant Variables:** The relevant variables are `x` and `sn`, both initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Before the loop begins: `x = 0`, `sn = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - After 1st iteration: `x = 1`, `sn = 1`
  - After 2nd iteration: `x = 2`, `sn = 2`
  - After 3rd iteration: `x = 3`, `sn = 3`
  - After 4th iteration: `x = 4`, `sn = 4`
  - After 5th iteration: `x = 5`, `sn = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - If the loop terminates after these iterations, the values of `x` and `sn` will be equal (`x = sn`).

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):** The post-condition is `assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);`. This means if `sn` is not equal to `x`, then `sn` should be -1.

- **Analysis of Verification Goal:**
  - **Can it be used as an invariant?**
    - **NO:** The post-condition is not suitable as a loop invariant because it is only relevant at termination, not during the loop's execution. During the loop, `sn` and `x` are always equal, so the condition `(sn != x)` is never true unless the loop never executes.
  
- **Modification for Invariant:**
  - A suitable loop invariant can be: `sn == x`. This invariant holds true before the loop starts, is preserved through each iteration, and when combined with the negation of the loop condition, can help imply the post-condition.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `sn == x`

- **Explanation:**
  - This invariant is valid because it accurately reflects the relationship between `sn` and `x` throughout the loop. Initially, both are zero, and each iteration increments both by the same amount, maintaining equality.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Establishment of Invariant:**
  - Before the loop begins, both `sn` and `x` are initialized to 0, so the invariant `sn == x` holds true (`0 == 0`).

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Preservation of Invariant:**
  - Assuming the invariant `sn == x` holds at the start of an iteration, after executing the loop body (`x = x + 1; sn = sn + 1;`), both `sn` and `x` are incremented by 1. Thus, if `sn == x` was true before the iteration, it remains true after the iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **State of Variables at Termination:**
  - When the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false, the loop terminates. At this point, `sn == x` still holds true, as it has been preserved throughout the loop.

- **Invariant Validity at Termination:**
  - The invariant `sn == x` remains valid at termination because the loop's operations maintain this equality throughout execution.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Evaluation of Post-condition:**
  - The post-condition `assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);` is correct because if the loop never executes (i.e., `unknown()` is false initially), `sn` remains 0 and `x` remains 0, thus `(sn != x)` is false, and the assertion trivially holds. If the loop executes at least once, `sn == x` holds, making `(sn != x)` false, thus the implication is vacuously true.

- **Proof Using Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:**
  - When the loop terminates, `sn == x` holds. If `sn != x` were true, the loop would have never executed, implying `sn == -1` (which is not possible due to initialization). Thus, the invariant `sn == x` combined with loop termination conditions ensures the post-condition holds.
