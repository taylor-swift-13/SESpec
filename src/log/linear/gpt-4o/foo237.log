#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The purpose of the loop is to increment the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` in a synchronized manner until `k` reaches a specified limit. Specifically, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` by 2, and `k` by 3 in each iteration. The intended outcome is that when the loop terminates, the assertion `k == (i + j)` holds true.

- **Loop Structure**: 
  - **Governing Condition**: The loop continues as long as `k < 268435455`.
  - **Operations Performed**: Within the loop body:
    - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
    - `j` is incremented by 2 (`j = j + 2`).
    - `k` is incremented by 3 (`k = k + 3`).
  - **Relevant Variables**: `i`, `j`, and `k`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - Before the loop begins: `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: `i = 1`, `j = 2`, `k = 3`.
  - **Iteration 2**: `i = 2`, `j = 4`, `k = 6`.
  - **Iteration 3**: `i = 3`, `j = 6`, `k = 9`.
  - **Iteration 4**: `i = 4`, `j = 8`, `k = 12`.
  - **Iteration 5**: `i = 5`, `j = 10`, `k = 15`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 268435455, resulting in `i = 89478485`, `j = 178956970`, `k = 268435455`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition to be proven is `k == (i + j)`.

- **Use as Invariant**: 
  - **No**, the verification goal `k == (i + j)` cannot be directly used as a loop invariant because it only holds true at termination, not during the iterations.

- **Modification for Invariant**:
  - A suitable invariant can be `k == (i + j) / 3`. This holds true before the loop starts, during each iteration, and can be used to imply the post-condition at termination.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: In natural language, the invariant is that the sum of `i` and `j` is always three times the value of `k`.

- **Explanation**: 
  - Initially, `i + j = 0`, which is three times `k = 0`.
  - In each iteration, `i` increases by 1, `j` by 2, making `i + j` increase by 3, which matches the increment of `k` by 3.
  - Thus, `i + j` is always three times `k`, preserving the invariant.

#### e. Establishment

- **Invariant Establishment**: 
  - Before the loop starts, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, and `k = 0`. Thus, `i + j = 0` and `k = 0`, satisfying `i + j == 3 * k`.

#### f. Preservation

- **Invariant Preservation**:
  - Assume `i + j == 3 * k` holds at the beginning of an iteration.
  - After incrementing: `i' = i + 1`, `j' = j + 2`, `k' = k + 3`.
  - New sum: `i' + j' = (i + 1) + (j + 2) = i + j + 3`.
  - New `k`: `k' = k + 3`.
  - Thus, `i' + j' == 3 * k'` is preserved.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State**: 
  - When `k = 268435455`, the loop condition `k < 268435455` becomes false, and the loop terminates.
  - At this point, `i + j = 3 * k`, and since `k` is no longer incrementing, `k == (i + j)` holds true.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation**: The post-condition `k == (i + j)` is correct.
- **Proof**: 
  - The invariant `i + j == 3 * k` combined with the negation of the loop condition (`k >= 268435455`) implies `k == (i + j)` because `i + j` and `k` have reached their final values with `i + j = 3 * k` and `k` being exactly `268435455`.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
