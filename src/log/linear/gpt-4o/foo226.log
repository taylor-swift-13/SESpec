```c
void foo226() {

    int x;
    int y;

    x = 1;
    y = 0;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

    /*@ assert x == 0; */
}
```

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  - The loop's purpose is to increment the variable `y` from its initial value of `0` until it reaches `1024`. During each iteration, the variable `x` is set to `0`. The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, `x` remains `0`, and `y` is `1024`.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** The loop continues executing as long as `y < 1024`.
  - **Operations in the Body:** Within each iteration, `x` is set to `0`, and `y` is incremented by `1`.
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y` are the relevant variables. `x` is reset to `0` in each iteration, and `y` is the loop control variable that determines when the loop terminates.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Before the loop begins, `x = 1` and `y = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - After Iteration 1: `x = 0`, `y = 1`
  - After Iteration 2: `x = 0`, `y = 2`
  - After Iteration 3: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
  - After Iteration 4: `x = 0`, `y = 4`
  - After Iteration 5: `x = 0`, `y = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - When the loop terminates: `x = 0`, `y = 1024`

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):** The post-condition is `x == 0`.

- **Can it serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **YES:** The verification goal `x == 0` can be directly used as part of the loop invariant because `x` is set to `0` at the start of each iteration and remains `0` throughout the loop's execution.

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `x == 0`

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Loop Invariant in Natural Language:**
  - The variable `x` is always `0` at the beginning and end of each loop iteration.

- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - The invariant `x == 0` is valid because `x` is explicitly set to `0` in each iteration of the loop, ensuring that `x` remains `0` throughout the loop's execution.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **How the Invariant is Established:**
  - Before the loop starts, `x` is initially set to `1`. However, the first operation within the loop body sets `x` to `0`. Therefore, the invariant `x == 0` is established before the first iteration completes.

- **Pre-condition Guarantee:**
  - The pre-condition does not directly establish the invariant, but the loop body does by setting `x = 0` in the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **How the Invariant is Preserved:**
  - At the beginning of each iteration, `x` is set to `0`. Since the operation `x = 0` is performed at the start of each iteration, the invariant `x == 0` holds true at the end of each iteration.

- **Demonstration of Preservation:**
  - If `x == 0` at the start of an iteration, it remains `0` because the operation `x = 0` ensures this. Thus, the invariant is preserved throughout the loop.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **State of Variables upon Termination:**
  - When the loop terminates, `y = 1024` and `x = 0`.

- **Validity of Loop Invariant at Termination:**
  - The loop invariant `x == 0` remains valid at termination because `x` is set to `0` in each iteration, including the last one.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Evaluation of Post-condition:**
  - The post-condition `x == 0` is correct.

- **Proof using Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:**
  - The invariant `x == 0` is maintained throughout the loop. When the loop condition `y < 1024` becomes false (i.e., `y == 1024`), the invariant `x == 0` still holds, proving the post-condition is met.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.
