---

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**:
  The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value of `0` until it reaches the value `6`. The loop ensures that `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, and it stops when `x` is no longer less than `6`. Upon termination, the loop guarantees that `x == 6`.

- **Loop Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (x < 6)`
    - The loop continues executing as long as `x` is strictly less than `6`.
  - **Operations in the Body**: 
    - The statement `x = x + 1` increments the value of `x` by `1` in each iteration.
  - **Relevant Variables**:
    - `x`: The loop variable being incremented and checked against the termination condition.

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Initial value of `x`: `0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After **Iteration 1**:
    - `x` is incremented from `0` to `1`.
  - After **Iteration 2**:
    - `x` is incremented from `1` to `2`.
  - After **Iteration 3**:
    - `x` is incremented from `2` to `3`.
  - After **Iteration 4**:
    - `x` is incremented from `3` to `4`.
  - After **Iteration 5**:
    - `x` is incremented from `4` to `5`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - The loop terminates after the sixth iteration when `x` is incremented from `5` to `6`.
  - Final value of `x`: `6`

---

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-Condition)**:
  The post-condition is `x == 6`. This means that after the loop terminates, the value of `x` must be exactly `6`.

- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as a Loop Invariant?**
  - **No**, the verification goal `x == 6` cannot serve as a loop invariant because it is only true at the point of loop termination. During the iterations of the loop, `x` takes on values less than `6`, so `x == 6` is not true throughout the loop's execution.

- **Can the Verification Goal Be Modified to Create a Valid Invariant?**
  - **Yes**, the verification goal can be modified to create a valid invariant. A suitable invariant would describe the relationship between `x` and the loop condition during the loop's execution. For example, a valid invariant is: `0 <= x && x <= 6`. This invariant holds true before the loop begins, during every iteration, and upon loop termination.

  - **Establishment**: `0 <= x && x <= 6` is true before the first iteration because `x` is initialized to `0`.
  - **Preservation**: If `0 <= x && x <= 6` is true at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `x < 6` is true, then incrementing `x` by `1` ensures that `0 <= x && x <= 6` remains true.
  - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, the invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x >= 6`), implies the post-condition `x == 6`.

---

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**:
  `0 <= x && x <= 6`

- **Explanation of Validity**:
  - The invariant describes the bounds on the value of `x` during the loop's execution. It states that `x` is always non-negative and does not exceed `6`.
  - This invariant is valid because:
    1. It holds true before the loop starts (`x` is initialized to `0`).
    2. It is preserved during each iteration of the loop.
    3. It remains true when the loop terminates, and in combination with the negation of the loop condition, it implies the post-condition.

---

#### e. Establishment

- **How the Invariant Is Established**:
  - Before the loop begins, `x` is initialized to `0`.
  - The invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6` is satisfied because `0 <= 0 && 0 <= 6` is true.

- **Pre-Condition Guarantee**:
  - The pre-condition (initialization of `x` to `0`) ensures that the invariant holds true before the first iteration.

---

#### f. Preservation

- **How the Invariant Is Preserved**:
  - Assume the invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6` is true at the start of an iteration, and the loop condition `x < 6` is also true.
  - During the iteration, `x` is incremented by `1` (`x = x + 1`).
  - After the increment:
    - `x` is still non-negative because it was non-negative before the increment.
    - `x` does not exceed `6` because the loop condition `x < 6` ensures that `x + 1 <= 6`.
  - Therefore, the invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6` remains true at the end of the iteration.

---

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables Upon Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when the condition `x < 6` becomes false. This happens when `x == 6`.
  - At this point, the invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6` is still true because `x == 6`.

- **Why the Invariant Remains Valid**:
  - Upon termination, `x == 6` satisfies the invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6`.

---

#### h. Post-Condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-Condition**:
  - The post-condition `x == 6` is correct.

- **How the Invariant Proves the Post-Condition**:
  - The invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6` is true throughout the loop's execution.
  - When the loop terminates, the negation of the loop condition (`x >= 6`) is true. Combining this with the invariant (`x <= 6`), we deduce that `x == 6`.
  - Thus, the post-condition `x == 6` is satisfied.

---

### Final Summary

- The loop invariant `0 <= x && x <= 6` is valid and satisfies the requirements of establishment, preservation, and termination.
- The post-condition `x == 6` is correct and is proven by the loop invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition.
