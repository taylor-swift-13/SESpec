2025-12-22 20:00:01,272 - INFO  - think in natural language: To perform a loop verification analysis on the provided C code snippet, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the task description.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from 1 to 101 (exclusive) and to update the variable `y` such that `y` equals `100 - x` during each iteration. By the end of the loop, the goal is to ensure that `y` is less than 100.

- **Loop Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while (x <= 100)`
  - **Operations Performed:**
    - `y = 100 - x;`
    - `x = x + 1;`
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x` and `y`

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Before the loop starts: `x = 1`, `y` is uninitialized.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **After Iteration 1:** `x = 2`, `y = 100 - 1 = 99`
  - **After Iteration 2:** `x = 3`, `y = 100 - 2 = 98`
  - **After Iteration 3:** `x = 4`, `y = 100 - 3 = 97`
  - **After Iteration 4:** `x = 5`, `y = 100 - 4 = 96`
  - **After Iteration 5:** `x = 6`, `y = 100 - 5 = 95`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - When the loop terminates: `x = 101`, `y = 100 - 100 = 0`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `y < 100`
- **Analysis:**
  - The verification goal `y < 100` is not suitable as a loop invariant because it is not true during all iterations. For instance, at the start of the loop when `x = 1`, `y` becomes `99`, which satisfies the goal, but it is not a useful invariant to maintain throughout the loop.
  - **Modified Invariant Proposal:** A suitable invariant could be `y = 100 - x` because:
    - **Establishment:** Initially, `x = 1`, so `y = 100 - 1 = 99`, which satisfies the invariant.
    - **Preservation:** If `y = 100 - x` holds at the start of an iteration, after incrementing `x` by 1 and updating `y`, the invariant will still hold.
    - **Termination:** When the loop exits (`x > 100`), the invariant `y = 100 - x` implies `y < 100` since `x` will be 101.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `y = 100 - x`
- **Explanation:** This invariant is valid because it accurately describes the relationship between `x` and `y` at the start and end of each iteration. It is directly derived from the loop body operations and holds throughout the loop's execution.

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment Explanation:** 
  - Before the loop starts, `x = 1`, and the initial assignment `y = 100 - x` ensures that `y = 99`. Thus, the invariant `y = 100 - x` is established before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation Explanation:**
  - Assume `y = 100 - x` holds at the beginning of an iteration. During the iteration, `x` is incremented by 1 (`x = x + 1`), and `y` is updated to `100 - x`. Therefore, the invariant `y = 100 - x` continues to hold at the end of the iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State:**
  - When the loop terminates, `x = 101`, and `y = 100 - 101 = -1`.
- **Termination Validity:**
  - The invariant `y = 100 - x` holds when the loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false. The final state of `y` when `x = 101` is `-1`, which is less than 100, satisfying the post-condition.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation:**
  - The post-condition `y < 100` is correct.
- **Proof Explanation:**
  - The invariant `y = 100 - x`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x > 100`), ensures that `y < 100` upon loop termination. This satisfies the post-condition, demonstrating its correctness.

2025-12-22 20:14:37,395 - INFO  - think in natural language: Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the given C code snippet focusing on loop invariants and their verification.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The loop's purpose is to increment the variable `x` from 1 to 101 while simultaneously adjusting the value of `y` such that `y` equals `100 - x` at each iteration. The intended outcome is to update `y` to be less than 100 once the loop completes.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x <= 100)`
  - The loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.
- **Operations in the Body:**
  - `y = 100 - x;` sets `y` to the difference between 100 and the current value of `x`.
  - `x = x + 1;` increments `x` by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: Controls the loop iteration and is incremented in each iteration.
  - `y`: Updated in each iteration based on the current value of `x`.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 1`
- `y` is not initialized, but will be set to `100 - x` in the first iteration.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - `x = 2`
   - `y = 100 - 1 = 99`
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `x = 3`
   - `y = 100 - 2 = 98`
3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `x = 4`
   - `y = 100 - 3 = 97`
4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `x = 5`
   - `y = 100 - 4 = 96`
5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `x = 6`
   - `y = 100 - 5 = 95`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The loop terminates when `x = 101`.
- At this point, `y = 100 - 100 = 0`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
- The post-condition is `y < 100`.

**Analysis:**
- The verification goal cannot directly serve as a loop invariant because it is not true during all iterations of the loop. Specifically, `y` starts at 99 and decreases by 1 in each iteration, so it is not always less than 100 during the loop execution.

**Modified Invariant Proposal:**
- A suitable invariant is: `y = 100 - x`.
  - **Establishment:** True before the first iteration since `x` starts at 1, and `y` is set to `100 - x`.
  - **Preservation:** If `y = 100 - x` holds at the start of an iteration, it will hold at the end because both `x` and `y` are updated in a manner that maintains this relationship.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x = 101`, thus `y = 100 - 101 = -1`, which satisfies the post-condition `y < 100`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- `y = 100 - x`

**Explanation:**
- This invariant holds true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration because `y` is explicitly set to `100 - x` in each iteration. The invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop's execution.

### e. Establishment

**Explanation:**
- Before the loop starts, `x = 1`. When the loop begins, `y` is immediately set to `100 - x`, which is `99`. Thus, the invariant `y = 100 - x` is established before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**Explanation:**
- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `y = 100 - x`.
- During the iteration, `x` is incremented by 1 (`x = x + 1`), and `y` is updated to `100 - x`.
- The invariant `y = 100 - x` continues to hold because the operations maintain this relationship.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State at Termination:**
- The loop condition `x <= 100` becomes false when `x = 101`.
- At this point, `y = 100 - 101 = -1`.

**Invariant Validity:**
- The invariant `y = 100 - x` holds true even at termination since `y` is calculated as `100 - x`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation:**
- The post-condition `y < 100` is correct.
- When the loop terminates, `x = 101`, leading to `y = -1`, which is indeed less than 100.
- The invariant `y = 100 - x`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x > 100`), ensures that the post-condition `y < 100` is satisfied.

In conclusion, the loop invariant `y = 100 - x` is valid, and it helps in proving the correctness of the post-condition `y < 100`.

2025-12-22 20:14:37,436 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo66(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          PLACE_HOLDER_LOOP
            */
            while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }
            

    /*@ assert (y < 100); */

}`

2025-12-22 20:14:37,436 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.

2025-12-22 20:29:21,728 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  The purpose of the loop is to iterate over the variable `x` from 1 to 100, incrementing `x` by 1 in each iteration. During each iteration, the variable `y` is set to `100 - x`. The intended outcome is that after the loop completes, `y` will be less than 100.

- **Loop Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while (x <= 100)`
  - **Operations in the Body:**
    - `y = 100 - x;` assigns `y` the value of `100 - x`.
    - `x = x + 1;` increments `x` by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables:**
    - `x`: Starts at 1 and is incremented until it exceeds 100.
    - `y`: Calculated as `100 - x` in each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x = 1`
  - `y` is uninitialized at this point.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  1. **After Iteration 1:**
     - `x = 2`
     - `y = 100 - 1 = 99`
  2. **After Iteration 2:**
     - `x = 3`
     - `y = 100 - 2 = 98`
  3. **After Iteration 3:**
     - `x = 4`
     - `y = 100 - 3 = 97`
  4. **After Iteration 4:**
     - `x = 5`
     - `y = 100 - 4 = 96`
  5. **After Iteration 5:**
     - `x = 6`
     - `y = 100 - 5 = 95`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - When `x = 101`, the loop terminates.
  - `y = 100 - 100 = 0`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `y < 100`
- **Analysis:**
  - The verification goal `y < 100` cannot directly serve as an invariant because it is not true during the loop iterations (e.g., `y = 99` in the first iteration).
  - **Modification for Invariant:**
    - A suitable invariant is `y = 100 - x` and `x <= 101`.
    - **Establishment:** `y = 100 - x` holds before the first iteration as `x = 1` and `y` is set to `99`.
    - **Preservation:** If `y = 100 - x` holds at the start of an iteration, after executing `y = 100 - x` and `x = x + 1`, it will still hold.
    - **Termination:** When the loop exits, `x = 101`, so `y = 100 - 101 = -1`, which implies `y < 100`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `y = 100 - x` and `x <= 101`
- **Explanation:**
  - This invariant is valid because it captures the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop. It holds true before the loop starts, is maintained throughout the loop, and ensures the post-condition when the loop terminates.

### e. Establishment

- **Explanation:**
  - Before the first iteration, `x = 1` and `y = 100 - x = 99`. Thus, `y = 100 - x` holds, and `x <= 101` is true.

### f. Preservation

- **Explanation:**
  - Assume `y = 100 - x` and `x <= 101` holds at the start of an iteration.
  - After executing `y = 100 - x`, `y` remains `100 - x`.
  - Increment `x` by 1: `x' = x + 1`.
  - Now `y = 100 - x'`, and `x' <= 101` still holds, preserving the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination Condition:** `x > 100`
- **State at Termination:**
  - `x = 101`
  - `y = 100 - 101 = -1`
- **Explanation:**
  - The invariant `y = 100 - x` and `x <= 101` holds true at termination. The loop condition `x <= 100` is false, and the invariant ensures `y < 100`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation:**
  - The post-condition `y < 100` is correct.
- **Explanation:**
  - When the loop terminates, `x = 101`, and thus `y = 100 - 101 = -1`, which satisfies `y < 100`. The invariant `y = 100 - x` combined with `x > 100` implies the post-condition `y < 100`.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.
