#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo51` is to manipulate the variable `c` based on certain conditions determined by the function `unknown()`. The loop continues executing as long as the condition `unknown()` evaluates to true. The intended outcome is to modify `c` in such a way that when the loop exits, the post-condition `(c != 4) ==> (c <= 4)` holds true.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop is governed by the condition `while (unknown())`, which implies that the loop will continue executing as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero (true) value.
- **Operations:**
  - If `unknown()` returns true and `c` is not equal to 4, `c` is incremented by 1.
  - If `unknown()` returns false and `c` is equal to 4, `c` is set to 1.
- **Relevant Variables:** The primary variable relevant to the loop's behavior is `c`, which is initially set to 0.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop begins, `c = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
- **Iteration 1:** Depending on the outcome of `unknown()`, `c` could become 1 if the first condition is met.
- **Iteration 2:** `c` could become 2 if the loop continues and the first condition remains true.
- **Iteration 3:** `c` could become 3.
- **Iteration 4:** `c` could become 4.
- **Iteration 5:** If `c` is 4 and the second condition is true, `c` resets to 1.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates, the exact value of `c` depends on the sequence of `unknown()` evaluations, but the post-condition `(c != 4) ==> (c <= 4)` must hold.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition `(c != 4) ==> (c <= 4)` needs to be proven.

**Analysis:**
- **Can it be used as an invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal is not suitable as a loop invariant because it only needs to hold at termination, not necessarily during each iteration.

**Modification to Create a Valid Invariant:**
- A potential invariant could be: `c <= 4`, which ensures that `c` never exceeds 4 during the loop's execution.
  - **Establishment:** Initially, `c = 0`, so `c <= 4` holds.
  - **Preservation:** The operations in the loop either increment `c` by 1 (up to 4) or reset `c` to 1, thus preserving `c <= 4`.
  - **Termination:** Upon termination, `c <= 4` combined with the negation of the loop condition implies `(c != 4) ==> (c <= 4)`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Invariant:**
- **Invariant:** `c <= 4`

**Explanation:**
- This invariant is valid because it is maintained throughout the loop's execution. The operations ensure that `c` never exceeds 4, and when `c` reaches 4, the second condition allows it to reset to 1.

#### e. Establishment

**Establishment:**
- Before the loop begins, `c = 0`, which satisfies the invariant `c <= 4`.

#### f. Preservation

**Preservation:**
- If `c <= 4` holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition is true:
  - If the first condition is true and `c != 4`, `c` is incremented by 1, maintaining `c <= 4`.
  - If the second condition is true and `c == 4`, `c` is reset to 1, maintaining `c <= 4`.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination:**
- When the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false, the invariant `c <= 4` still holds.
- The post-condition `(c != 4) ==> (c <= 4)` is satisfied because `c <= 4` and `c` cannot be greater than 4.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation:**
- The post-condition `(c != 4) ==> (c <= 4)` is correct.
- The invariant `c <= 4`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (loop termination), ensures that the post-condition is met. Since `c` never exceeds 4, if `c != 4`, then `c <= 4` is trivially true.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 18:58:21,321 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(c == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


void foo51(int n) {

    int c = 0;
