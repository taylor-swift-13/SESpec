2025-12-22 19:15:10,626 - INFO  - think in natural language: Let's perform a detailed loop verification analysis on the given C code snippet.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of the loop is to manipulate the variable `c` based on the conditions provided by the `unknown()` function. The loop aims to eventually set `c` to a value such that the post-condition `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)` holds true.

**Structure:**  
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues while `unknown()` returns true. This function is non-deterministic, meaning the loop's continuation is unpredictable.
- **Operations:** Inside the loop, the code checks the result of `unknown()`:
  - If `unknown()` returns true and `c` is not equal to `n`, it increments `c`.
  - If `unknown()` returns false and `c` is equal to `n`, it resets `c` to 1.
- **Relevant Variables:** The variable `c` is the primary focus, with `n` being a constant that affects `c`'s manipulation.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
- `c = 0` (initially set before the loop begins)

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**  
Due to the non-deterministic nature of `unknown()`, the exact values of `c` cannot be determined precisely. However, we can analyze possible changes:
1. **Iteration 1:** If `unknown()` is true and `c != n`, `c` becomes `1`. If `unknown()` is false and `c == n`, `c` becomes `1`.
2. **Iteration 2:** If `unknown()` remains true and `c != n`, `c` continues to increment. If `unknown()` becomes false and `c == n`, `c` resets to `1`.
3. **Iteration 3, 4, 5:** Similar logic applies, with `c` potentially incrementing or resetting based on `unknown()` and the comparison to `n`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false. The value of `c` is unpredictable but will be either equal to `n` or reset to `1`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**  
The post-condition `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)` needs to be proven.

**Analysis:**  
- The verification goal cannot directly serve as an invariant since it only needs to hold true upon loop termination.
- A suitable invariant would be `c <= n`, as it reflects the operations within the loop and can be used to reason about the loop's behavior.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
`c <= n`

**Explanation:**  
This invariant is valid because:
- It establishes a relationship between `c` and `n` that is maintained through the loop's operations.
- `c` is incremented only if it is not equal to `n`, ensuring it never exceeds `n`.
- If `c` equals `n`, it is reset to `1`, maintaining the invariant.

### e. Establishment

**Invariant Establishment:**  
Before the loop begins, `c` is initialized to `0`. Given the pre-condition `n > 0`, `c <= n` holds true initially.

### f. Preservation

**Invariant Preservation:**  
During each iteration:
- If `unknown()` is true and `c != n`, `c` is incremented, but it remains `<= n`.
- If `unknown()` is false and `c == n`, `c` resets to `1`, which is still `<= n`.

Thus, the invariant `c <= n` is preserved.

### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination State:**  
The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false. At this point, `c` is either `n` or reset to `1`.

**Invariant Validity:**  
The invariant `c <= n` remains valid upon termination.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation:**  
The post-condition `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)` is correct.

**Explanation:**  
The invariant `c <= n`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (i.e., loop termination), implies that if `c == n`, then `n > -1` holds true due to the pre-condition `n > 0`.

Thus, the post-condition is met, and the loop behavior is correctly verified.

Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.

2025-12-22 19:15:10,654 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (c == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */

    int c = 0;
