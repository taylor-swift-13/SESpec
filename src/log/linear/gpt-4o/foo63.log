#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The purpose of the loop is to iterate from `x = 1` to `x = 10`, updating the variable `y` such that `y = 10 - x` in each iteration. The loop calculates the difference between 10 and the current value of `x`, storing this result in `y`.

- **Structure**: 
  - **Governing Condition**: The loop continues while `x <= 10`.
  - **Operations**: Within the loop body, `y` is assigned the value `10 - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1 (`x = x + 1`).
  - **Relevant Variables**: The variables relevant to the loop's behavior are `x` and `y`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - Before the loop begins, `x = 1` and `y` is uninitialized.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: `x = 2`, `y = 10 - 1 = 9`
  - **Iteration 2**: `x = 3`, `y = 10 - 2 = 8`
  - **Iteration 3**: `x = 4`, `y = 10 - 3 = 7`
  - **Iteration 4**: `x = 5`, `y = 10 - 4 = 6`
  - **Iteration 5**: `x = 6`, `y = 10 - 5 = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - After the loop terminates (when `x = 11`), `y = 10 - 10 = 0`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition is `y >= 0`.

- **Analysis**:
  - The verification goal (`y >= 0`) cannot be directly used as an invariant because it does not capture the relationship between `x` and `y` during the loop iterations. It is only guaranteed to be true at termination.
  
- **Modification**:
  - A suitable invariant would be `y = 10 - x`. This invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop and implies `y >= 0` at termination because when the loop terminates, `x = 11`, making `y = 10 - 10 = 0`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Invariant**: `y = 10 - x`

- **Explanation**: 
  - This invariant is valid because it correctly represents the calculation performed in each iteration. At the start and end of each iteration, `y` is assigned the value `10 - x`, which is preserved through the loop's execution.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Establishment**:
  - Before the loop starts, `x = 1`, and the first operation in the loop assigns `y = 10 - x`, which is `y = 9`. Thus, the invariant `y = 10 - x` holds before the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Preservation**:
  - Assume the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration: `y = 10 - x`.
  - After executing the loop body, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is reassigned `y = 10 - x`. Thus, the invariant is preserved.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `x = 11`. At this point, `y = 10 - 10 = 0`, which satisfies the invariant `y = 10 - x`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Correctness**:
  - The post-condition `y >= 0` is correct. When the loop terminates, `x = 11`, and `y = 10 - 10 = 0`, which satisfies `y >= 0`.
  
- **Proof**:
  - The invariant `y = 10 - x` combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x > 10`) implies `y = 0`, which satisfies the post-condition `y >= 0`.

2025-12-22 19:24:38,868 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The error indicates that the loop invariant `((x == 1) && (y == \at(y,Pre))) || (y == 10 - x)` is not preserved after each iteration. The invariant fails because it does not accurately capture the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop. The condition `((x == 1) && (y == \at(y,Pre)))` is only valid at the very start of the loop and does not hold in subsequent iterations. The part `(y == 10 - x)` is correct but needs to be the primary invariant.

2. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `/*@ assert (y >= 0); */` fails because the loop invariant does not guarantee that `y >= 0` at termination. The invariant needs to be strong enough to imply the postcondition when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo63(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant y == 10 - x;
      loop invariant x >= 1 && x <= 11;
      loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while (x <= 10) {
        y = 10 - x;
        x = x + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert (y >= 0); */
}
