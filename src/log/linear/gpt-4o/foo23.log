---

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop modifies two integer variables, `i` and `j`, iteratively. The goal is to increment `i` by 2 and decrement `j` by 1 until the condition `j >= i` is no longer satisfied. After the loop terminates, the function asserts that `j == 13`.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (j >= i)`
  - The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `i`.
- **Operations in the Body:**
  - `i = i + 2;` increments `i` by 2.
  - `j = j - 1;` decrements `j` by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `i`: Starts at 1 and increases by 2 in each iteration.
  - `j`: Starts at 20 and decreases by 1 in each iteration.

---

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values:
  - `i = 1`
  - `j = 20`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - `i = 3` (incremented by 2)
   - `j = 19` (decremented by 1)

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `i = 5`
   - `j = 18`

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `i = 7`
   - `j = 17`

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `i = 9`
   - `j = 16`

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `i = 11`
   - `j = 15`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The loop terminates when `j < i`. This occurs after the 7th iteration:
  - Final values:
    - `i = 15`
    - `j = 13`

---

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition to be proven is `j == 13`.

**Can the verification goal be used as part of the loop invariant?**
- **No**, the verification goal (`j == 13`) is specific to the state of `j` after the loop terminates. It does not hold during all iterations of the loop, so it cannot be directly used as a loop invariant.

**Can the verification goal be modified to create a valid invariant?**
- **Yes**, the verification goal can be generalized into a valid invariant by describing the relationship between `i` and `j` throughout the loop's execution. The invariant must capture the iterative changes to `i` and `j` while ensuring that the loop eventually terminates with `j == 13`.

---

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
At the start and end of every iteration:
`j - i = 19`

**Explanation:**
- Initially, `j - i = 20 - 1 = 19`, which is true before the loop begins.
- In each iteration:
  - `i` increases by 2.
  - `j` decreases by 1.
  - The difference between `j` and `i` remains constant (`j - i = 19`).
- When the loop terminates (`j < i`), the invariant still holds, and combined with the negation of the loop condition, it implies the post-condition `j == 13`.

---

#### e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established:**
- Before the loop begins, `i = 1` and `j = 20`.
- The invariant `j - i = 19` holds because `20 - 1 = 19`.

**Pre-condition guarantees:**
The initial values of `i` and `j` ensure that the invariant is true before the first iteration.

---

#### f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved:**
- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `j - i = 19`.
- During the iteration:
  - `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`).
  - `j` is decremented by 1 (`j = j - 1`).
- After the updates:
  - New `j - i = (j - 1) - (i + 2) = j - i - 3`.
  - Substituting the previous value of `j - i = 19`:
    - New `j - i = 19`.
- Therefore, the invariant is preserved.

---

#### g. Termination Analysis

**State of variables when the loop terminates:**
- The loop condition `j >= i` becomes false when `j < i`.
- From the invariant `j - i = 19`, we know the relationship between `j` and `i`.
- When the loop terminates:
  - `i = 15`
  - `j = 13`
- The invariant remains valid (`j - i = 19`).

---

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the post-condition:**
- The post-condition `j == 13` is correct.
- When the loop terminates:
  - The invariant `j - i = 19` still holds.
  - Combined with the termination condition `j < i`, we deduce:
    - `i = 15` and `j = 13`.
- Thus, the post-condition `j == 13` is satisfied.

**How the invariant proves the post-condition:**
- The invariant (`j - i = 19`) ensures that the relationship between `i` and `j` is consistent throughout the loop.
- When the loop terminates (`j < i`), the invariant guarantees that `j == 13`.

---

### Final Summary

The loop invariant `j - i = 19` is valid because it is:
1. **Established** before the loop begins (`j - i = 19` when `i = 1` and `j = 20`).
2. **Preserved** through each iteration of the loop (`j - i` remains constant as `i` increases by 2 and `j` decreases by 1).
3. **Valid at termination**, where it implies the post-condition `j == 13`.
