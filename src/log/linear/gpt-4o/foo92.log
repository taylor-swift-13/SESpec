2025-12-22 16:56:20,109 - INFO  - think in natural language: To analyze the given C code snippet and verify the loop, we need to follow the structured approach provided. Let's break it down step by step.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
  The loop appears to be designed to increment the variable `y` by the value of `x` as long as `y` is non-negative. However, without any change to `x` or `y` that would cause `y` to become negative, the loop could potentially run indefinitely if `x` is non-negative or zero.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while(y >= 0)`
  - **Operations Performed in the Body:** `y = y + x;`
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x`, `y`

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  Since `x = 0`, the loop will not modify `y`, and it will run indefinitely because `y` will always remain `0` and thus non-negative. However, for the sake of analysis, let's assume `x` can be some positive value, say `x = 1`, to see how the loop would behave:

  - **Iteration 1:** `y = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - **Iteration 2:** `y = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - **Iteration 3:** `y = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - **Iteration 4:** `y = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - **Iteration 5:** `y = 4 + 1 = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  If `x` were negative, say `x = -1`, the loop would terminate when `y` becomes negative. For example:
  - **Iteration 1:** `y = 0 + (-1) = -1` (loop terminates)

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `assert y >= 0;`
- **Analysis:**
  - **Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
    - **No:** The post-condition `y >= 0` cannot serve as a loop invariant because the loop is governed by `y >= 0`, and the invariant must hold true before the loop starts, during each iteration, and upon termination.
  - **Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
    - The invariant could be `y >= initial_y`, where `initial_y` is the value of `y` before the loop starts. This would ensure that `y` does not decrease, which is true given the loop body `y = y + x` with `x >= 0`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:**
  - **Invariant:** `y >= 0`
  - **Explanation:** This invariant holds because the loop condition itself (`y >= 0`) ensures that `y` is non-negative at the start of each iteration. Since `x` is added to `y`, `y` will not decrease if `x` is non-negative.

### e. Establishment

- **Invariant Establishment:**
  - Before the loop starts, `y = 0`, which satisfies `y >= 0`.

### f. Preservation

- **Invariant Preservation:**
  - If `y >= 0` at the start of an iteration and `x >= 0`, then after `y = y + x`, `y` will still be `>= 0`. Thus, the invariant is preserved.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination Conditions:**
  - The loop terminates when `y < 0`. However, if `x >= 0`, the loop will not terminate as `y` will always remain non-negative.
  - If `x < 0`, `y` will eventually become negative, causing the loop to terminate. At termination, `y < 0` and the loop invariant no longer needs to hold.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation:**
  - The post-condition `assert y >= 0;` is incorrect if `x < 0`, as `y` will become negative and the loop will terminate. 
  - If `x >= 0`, the loop never terminates, making the post-condition irrelevant in practice.

In conclusion, the loop is designed in such a way that it may not terminate unless `x` is negative. The invariant `y >= 0` holds throughout the loop's execution if `x >= 0`, but the post-condition is not valid if the loop terminates with `x < 0`.

2025-12-22 16:56:23,313 - DEBUG  - To fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we need to ensure that the invariant correctly captures the behavior of the loop. Based on the pre-condition provided, here is the complete C code with the necessary ACSL annotations:

The loop invariant `y >= 0` ensures that `y` remains non-negative throughout the loop execution. The invariant `x == 0` reflects the fact that `x` does not change and remains zero, as per the pre-condition. The `loop assigns y;` specifies that `y` is the only variable being modified within the loop.

- `PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS` is replaced with `y`, as `y` is the only variable being modified within the loop.

2025-12-22 16:56:30,202 - DEBUG  - To fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we need to ensure that the invariant correctly captures the behavior of the loop and reflects the pre-condition and post-condition. Here is the complete C code with the necessary ACSL annotations:

```c
void foo92(int z1, int z2, int z3) {

    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
      loop invariant y >= 0; // PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL
      loop invariant y == 0; // PLACE_HOLDER_y
      loop invariant x == 0;
      loop invariant z3 == \at(z3,Pre);
      loop invariant z2 == \at(z2,Pre);
      loop invariant z1 == \at(z1,Pre);
      loop assigns y; // PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS
    */
    while(y >= 0) {
        y = y + x;
    }
    
    /*@ assert y >= 0;*/

}
```

In this code, the placeholders are replaced as follows:
- `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL` is replaced with `y >= 0`, which is consistent with the loop condition and the assertion after the loop.
- `PLACE_HOLDER_y` is replaced with `y == 0`, reflecting the pre-condition that `y` starts at 0 and doesn't change due to `x` being 0.
- `PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS` is replaced with `y`, as `y` is the only variable being modified within the loop.
