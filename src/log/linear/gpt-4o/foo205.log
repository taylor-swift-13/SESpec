#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The purpose of the loop is to increment both `x` and `y` until `x` reaches 1024. The intended outcome is that both `x` and `y` will be equal when the loop terminates.

- **Structure**: 
  - **Governing Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x < 1024`.
  - **Operations**: Within each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1 (`x = x + 1`) and `y` is incremented by 1 (`y = y + 1`).
  - **Relevant Variables**: The variables relevant to the loop's behavior are `x` and `y`. Their values are synchronized during the loop's execution.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: Before the loop begins, `x` and `y` are equal, as `y` is initialized to `x`. Therefore, `x = y`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: After the first iteration, `x = x_initial + 1` and `y = y_initial + 1`. Thus, `x = y`.
  - **Iteration 2**: After the second iteration, `x = x_initial + 2` and `y = y_initial + 2`. Thus, `x = y`.
  - **Iteration 3**: After the third iteration, `x = x_initial + 3` and `y = y_initial + 3`. Thus, `x = y`.
  - **Iteration 4**: After the fourth iteration, `x = x_initial + 4` and `y = y_initial + 4`. Thus, `x = y`.
  - **Iteration 5**: After the fifth iteration, `x = x_initial + 5` and `y = y_initial + 5`. Thus, `x = y`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: When the loop terminates, `x = 1024`. Since `x` and `y` are incremented together, `y` will also be 1024.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**: The goal is to prove `x == y` when the loop terminates.

- **Can the Verification Goal be Used as an Invariant?**: 
  - **YES**: The verification goal `x == y` can be directly used as an invariant component because it is true before the loop starts (establishment), remains true during each iteration (preservation), and is true when the loop terminates (termination).

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: In natural language, the invariant is "x and y are equal."

- **Explanation**: 
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - **Establishment**: Initially, `y = x`, so `x == y` is true before the loop starts.
    - **Preservation**: During each iteration, both `x` and `y` are incremented by 1, maintaining the equality `x == y`.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` has reached 1024, and since `x` and `y` were incremented equally, `y` is also 1024, satisfying `x == y`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Explanation**: The invariant `x == y` is established before the loop begins because `y` is initialized to `x`, ensuring that they are equal initially.

#### f. Preservation

- **Explanation**: 
  - If `x == y` is true at the beginning of an iteration and the loop condition `x < 1024` is true, then both `x` and `y` are incremented by 1.
  - Therefore, the equality `x == y` is preserved, as both variables undergo identical changes.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State**: When the loop terminates, `x = 1024` and `y = 1024` because both variables have been incremented equally from their initial values.

- **Invariant Validity**: The invariant `x == y` remains valid upon termination because both `x` and `y` are equal at 1024.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation**: The provided post-condition `x == y` is correct.

- **Explanation**: 
  - The invariant `x == y`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x >= 1024`), implies that when the loop terminates, both `x` and `y` are 1024, satisfying the post-condition `x == y`.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
