2025-12-22 17:48:44,103 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Loop Verification Analysis

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The loop increments the variable `x` by 4 repeatedly while an unknown condition is true. The intended outcome is that `x` will be a multiple of 4 after the loop terminates, as indicated by the post-condition `x % 4 == 0`.

- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while(unknown())`
  - **Operations in Body**: `x = x + 4;`
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x`

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - `x = 0` (before the loop starts)

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: `x = 4`
  - **Iteration 2**: `x = 8`
  - **Iteration 3**: `x = 12`
  - **Iteration 4**: `x = 16`
  - **Iteration 5**: `x = 20`

- **Post-Loop Sampling** (if applicable): 
  - If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, `x` would remain a multiple of 4. However, without knowledge of `unknown()`, we cannot predict the exact termination point.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: `x % 4 == 0` (post-condition)

- **Can the Verification Goal be used as an Invariant?**
  - **YES**: The verification goal can be used as an invariant component because `x` is initialized to 0 (a multiple of 4), and every iteration increases `x` by 4, maintaining the condition `x % 4 == 0`.

- **Modification**: No modification is needed as the verification goal is already suitable as an invariant.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x % 4 == 0`

- **Explanation**: 
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - **Establishment**: Initially, `x = 0`, and `0 % 4 == 0`.
    - **Preservation**: Adding 4 to a number that is a multiple of 4 results in another multiple of 4.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` will still be a multiple of 4.

#### e. Establishment

- **Explanation**: 
  - The invariant `x % 4 == 0` is established because `x` is initialized to 0, which is a multiple of 4. Thus, before the loop starts, the invariant holds true.

#### f. Preservation

- **Explanation**: 
  - If `x % 4 == 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration, then after executing `x = x + 4`, the new value of `x` will also satisfy `x % 4 == 0`. This is because adding 4 to a multiple of 4 results in another multiple of 4.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State at Termination**: 
  - When the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false, the invariant `x % 4 == 0` still holds because every iteration maintains this property.

- **Explanation**: 
  - The loop invariant remains valid at termination, as `x` has been incremented by 4 repeatedly, preserving the condition `x % 4 == 0`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation**: 
  - The provided post-condition `x % 4 == 0` is correct.

- **Explanation**: 
  - The invariant `x % 4 == 0`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (when `unknown()` becomes false), ensures that the post-condition `x % 4 == 0` is met after the loop terminates.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.
