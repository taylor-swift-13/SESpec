#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose:** The loop is designed to increment the variable `x` from an initial value of 0 up to 100,000,000. The increment strategy changes based on the value of `x`: it increments by 1 when `x` is less than 10,000,000, and by 2 otherwise. The intended outcome is to ensure that `x` reaches 100,000,000, and the post-condition `(x % 2)` suggests that `x` should be odd when the loop terminates.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while (x < 100000000)`
  - **Operations:**
    - If `x < 10000000`, increment `x` by 1 (`x++`).
    - Otherwise, increment `x` by 2 (`x += 2`).
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x`, which is an unsigned integer initialized to 0.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:** Before the loop begins, `x = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **Iteration 1:** `x = 1`
  - **Iteration 2:** `x = 2`
  - **Iteration 3:** `x = 3`
  - **Iteration 4:** `x = 4`
  - **Iteration 5:** `x = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:** The loop will terminate when `x` reaches 100,000,000. At termination, `x = 100,000,000`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal:** The post-condition `assert (x % 2)` implies that `x` should be odd when the loop terminates.

- **Can the Verification Goal be Used as an Invariant?**
  - **NO:** The goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because `x` is not always odd during iterations. It is only guaranteed to be odd at termination.

- **Modification for Invariant:**
  - **Establishment:** `x` starts at 0, which is even, but the invariant could be that `x` will be odd after reaching 10,000,000.
  - **Preservation:** Once `x` reaches 10,000,000, it is incremented by 2, which preserves oddness.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x` should be odd, as it would have been incremented by 2 from an odd number after 10,000,000.

- **Proposed Modification:** The invariant can be modified to state: "Once `x >= 10000000`, `x` is odd."

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Invariant:** "Once `x >= 10000000`, `x` is odd."

- **Explanation:** 
  - Initially, `x` is even and less than 10,000,000. Once `x` reaches 10,000,000, the increment by 2 ensures that `x` remains odd for all subsequent iterations.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `x = 0`, which is even. The invariant does not apply until `x` reaches 10,000,000, at which point the invariant begins to hold as `x` is incremented by 2 from an odd number.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Preservation:** 
  - If `x` is odd at the start of an iteration and `x >= 10000000`, incrementing by 2 preserves oddness. 
  - For iterations where `x < 10000000`, the invariant does not apply, but once `x` reaches 10,000,000, it becomes relevant and preserved.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **Termination State:** When the loop terminates, `x = 100,000,000`. At this point, `x` is even, which contradicts the post-condition `assert (x % 2)`. This indicates a flaw in the post-condition or the loop logic.

- **Invariant Validity:** The invariant holds during the loop, but the termination condition does not align with the post-condition as described.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Evaluation:** The provided post-condition `assert (x % 2)` is incorrect given the current loop logic. `x` is even at termination, contradicting the assertion.

- **Explanation:** The invariant ensures oddness only after `x` reaches 10,000,000 and is incremented by 2. However, since the loop terminates at 100,000,000 (an even number), the post-condition fails. Adjusting the loop to terminate at an odd number would satisfy the post-condition, but as it stands, the loop does not meet the specified assertion.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 18:15:12,506 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Assertion `assert (x % 2);`**

   The assertion `assert (x % 2);` checks whether `x` is odd at the end of the loop. The absence of a valid loop invariant means the assertion cannot be verified. The loop invariant must capture the parity of `x` as it transitions from being incremented by 1 to being incremented by 2, ensuring that `x` is odd when the loop terminates.

2. **Goal Establishment and Preservation**

   The loop invariant must be established at the start of the loop and preserved through each iteration. Initially, `x` is 0, which is even, and the invariant must accommodate this. As `x` transitions past 10,000,000, it must maintain odd parity, which the invariant must capture.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo303() {

    unsigned int x;

    x = 0;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
      loop invariant x >= 0;
      loop invariant (x < 10000000 ? x % 2 == 0 : x % 2 == 1);
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x < 100000000) {
        if (x < 10000000) {
            x++;
        } else {
            x += 2;
        }
    }

    /*@ assert (x % 2); */

}

2025-12-22 18:21:09,480 - INFO  - think in natural language: To perform a loop verification analysis for the given C code snippet, we will proceed with a structured analysis covering the loop's purpose, structure, variable sampling, verification goals, and loop invariants.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The loop is designed to increment the variable `x` until it reaches or exceeds 100,000,000. Initially, `x` is incremented by 1 if it is less than 10,000,000, and by 2 otherwise. The intended outcome is to exit the loop with `x` at least 100,000,000, and to ensure that `x` is odd when the loop terminates.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x < 100000000)`
- **Operations:**
  - If `x < 10000000`, increment `x` by 1.
  - Otherwise, increment `x` by 2.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: an unsigned integer initialized to 0.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **Iteration 1:**
   - Before: `x = 0`
   - After: `x = 1` (incremented by 1)

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - Before: `x = 1`
   - After: `x = 2` (incremented by 1)

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - Before: `x = 2`
   - After: `x = 3` (incremented by 1)

4. **Iteration 4:**
   - Before: `x = 3`
   - After: `x = 4` (incremented by 1)

5. **Iteration 5:**
   - Before: `x = 4`
   - After: `x = 5` (incremented by 1)

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The loop does not terminate within 5 iterations. It will continue until `x >= 100000000`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
- `assert (x % 2);` ensures that `x` is odd when the loop terminates.

**Analysis:**
- The verification goal cannot be directly used as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true at loop termination, not necessarily during every iteration.
- To create a valid invariant, consider the condition that `x` will eventually be odd when it exits the loop. 

**Modified Invariant:**
- The invariant could be that `x` is odd whenever `x >= 10000000`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- "If `x < 10000000`, then `x` is any integer. If `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd."

**Explanation:**
- Initially, `x` is incremented by 1, so it can be even or odd.
- Once `x` reaches 10,000,000, it is incremented by 2, preserving its parity (odd or even).
- The invariant ensures that when `x` is 10,000,000 or more, it remains odd.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment:**
- Initially, `x = 0`, which satisfies the invariant since `x < 10000000`.
- The invariant is trivially true before the first iteration as `x` is not yet greater than or equal to 10,000,000.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation:**
- If `x < 10000000`, `x` is incremented by 1, so it can change from even to odd or vice versa, but this is fine as the invariant does not restrict parity for `x < 10000000`.
- If `x >= 10000000`, it is incremented by 2, preserving its parity. If `x` was odd before the increment, it remains odd.

### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination State:**
- The loop terminates when `x >= 100000000`.
- At termination, `x` will be odd because, after reaching 10,000,000, `x` is incremented by 2, preserving its odd parity.

**Invariant Validity at Termination:**
- The invariant holds because `x` is odd when `x >= 10000000`, and it remains so until termination.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition Evaluation:**
- The post-condition `assert (x % 2);` is correct.

**Explanation:**
- The invariant, combined with the loop's termination condition, ensures that `x` is odd when the loop exits (`x >= 100000000`).
- Thus, the invariant supports the post-condition, proving it true upon loop termination.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 18:29:22,935 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

**Error 1: Goal Assertion**

- The assertion `assert (x % 2);` is incorrect because the current loop does not ensure that `x` is odd when the loop terminates. The loop invariant must be strengthened to guarantee that `x` is odd upon termination. The loop increments `x` by 1 when `x < 10,000,000` and by 2 when `x >= 10,000,000`, ensuring that `x` becomes odd once it surpasses 10,000,000. Therefore, the invariant should reflect the parity of `x` appropriately during the loop execution and upon termination.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo303() {

    unsigned int x;

    x = 0;

    /*@

2025-12-22 18:36:44,797 - INFO  - think in natural language: To analyze the given C code snippet with a focus on loop invariants, let's go through the structured analysis:

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The loop is designed to increment the variable `x` from an initial value of 0 until it reaches or exceeds 100,000,000. The loop increments `x` by 1 if `x` is less than 10,000,000, and by 2 otherwise. The intended outcome is to have `x` be an odd number when the loop terminates.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x < 100000000)`
- **Operations Performed:**
  - If `x < 10000000`, increment `x` by 1.
  - Otherwise, increment `x` by 2.
- **Relevant Variables:** `x`, which is an unsigned integer.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:** `x = 1` (incremented by 1)
2. **After Iteration 2:** `x = 2` (incremented by 1)
3. **After Iteration 3:** `x = 3` (incremented by 1)
4. **After Iteration 4:** `x = 4` (incremented by 1)
5. **After Iteration 5:** `x = 5` (incremented by 1)

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The loop will not terminate within the first five iterations, as the condition `x < 100000000` will remain true.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `assert (x % 2);` — This asserts that `x` is odd.

- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal `x % 2 == 1` (i.e., `x` is odd) cannot be used as an invariant because `x` starts at 0, which is even, and thus `x % 2` is not true at the start.

- **Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
  - A suitable invariant could be: "If `x < 10000000`, then `x` is even; if `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd."
  - **Establishment:** Initially, `x = 0` (even), satisfying the invariant.
  - **Preservation:** Incrementing `x` by 1 when `x < 10000000` keeps `x` even until it reaches 10,000,000. From then on, `x` is incremented by 2, preserving oddness.
  - **Termination:** When the loop exits, `x >= 100000000`, and since it was incremented by 2 from an odd number, `x` remains odd.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- "If `x < 10000000`, then `x` is even; if `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd."

**Explanation:**
- This invariant is valid because it accurately describes the parity of `x` throughout the loop execution. It captures the transition from even to odd when `x` reaches 10,000,000 and ensures the correct behavior as `x` is incremented.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment Explanation:**
- Initially, `x = 0`, which is even, satisfying the invariant. The pre-condition `x = 0` guarantees that `x` starts as even, establishing the invariant before the loop begins.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation Explanation:**
- If `x < 10000000`, incrementing by 1 maintains evenness. Once `x` reaches 10,000,000, it becomes odd, and further increments by 2 maintain oddness.
- Therefore, the invariant holds at the start and end of each iteration, as the operations performed do not violate the invariant conditions.

### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination State:**
- When the loop terminates, `x >= 100000000`.
- Since `x` was incremented by 2 from an odd starting point (10,000,000), `x` remains odd at termination.

**Invariant Validity at Termination:**
- The invariant holds true at termination because `x` is odd, satisfying the condition for `x >= 10000000`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition Evaluation:**
- The post-condition `assert (x % 2);` is correct.
- The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x >= 100000000`), ensures that `x` is odd at termination, proving the post-condition is met.

2025-12-22 18:36:44,827 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `x == 0`

Loop program: `

void foo303() {

    unsigned int x;

    x = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

       x++;
      }
       else {

      }

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
  The loop is designed to increment the variable `x` from 0 until it reaches or exceeds 100,000,000. The increment strategy changes based on the value of `x`: if `x` is less than 10,000,000, it is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is incremented by 2. The intended outcome is to have `x` be odd when the loop terminates.

- **Structure:**
  - **Governing Condition:** `while (x < 100000000)`
  - **Operations in Body:**
    - If `x < 10000000`, increment `x` by 1.
    - Otherwise, increment `x` by 2.
  - **Relevant Variables:** `x` (an unsigned integer)

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
  `x = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **Iteration 1:** `x = 1`
  - **Iteration 2:** `x = 2`
  - **Iteration 3:** `x = 3`
  - **Iteration 4:** `x = 4`
  - **Iteration 5:** `x = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**  
  Upon exiting the loop, `x = 100000001`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal:**  
  The post-condition is `assert (x % 2);`, which means `x` should be odd when the loop terminates.

- **Can the Verification Goal be Used as an Invariant?**  
  - **NO:** The verification goal (`x % 2`) cannot be used directly as an invariant because it only needs to be true at the termination of the loop, not during each iteration. During the loop, `x` can be even or odd.

- **Modification to Create a Valid Invariant:**  
  A suitable invariant could be that "if `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd." This invariant can be established, preserved, and used to imply the post-condition.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
  "If `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd."

- **Explanation:**  
  - **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `x = 0`, which is less than 10,000,000, so the invariant holds trivially.
  - **Preservation:** When `x < 10000000`, `x` is incremented by 1, and it can be either even or odd. When `x >= 10000000`, `x` is incremented by 2, preserving its oddness.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x >= 10000000` and `x < 100000000` is false, meaning `x >= 100000000`, ensuring `x` is odd.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Explanation:**  
  The invariant is trivially established before the loop begins because `x` starts at 0, which is less than 10,000,000, making the condition `x >= 10000000` false initially.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Explanation:**  
  If `x < 10000000`, the invariant condition is irrelevant. When `x >= 10000000`, `x` is odd due to the way increments are done (by 2), preserving the invariant through each iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **State of Variables at Termination:**  
  When the loop terminates, `x = 100000001`, which is odd.

- **Invariant Validity:**  
  The invariant holds because `x` is odd when `x >= 10000000`, and the loop terminates when `x >= 100000000`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Evaluation:**  
  The post-condition `assert (x % 2);` is correct.

- **Explanation:**  
  The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x >= 100000000`), ensures that `x` is odd when the loop terminates, satisfying the post-condition.

2025-12-22 18:51:54,790 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `x == 0`

Loop program: `

void foo303() {

    unsigned int x;

    x = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

       x++;
      }
       else {
       x += 2;
      }
      }

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: 
  The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value of 0 until it reaches or exceeds 100,000,000. The loop increments `x` by 1 if `x` is less than 10,000,000, and by 2 if `x` is 10,000,000 or greater. The intended outcome is for `x` to be a large number, specifically, the smallest odd number greater than or equal to 100,000,000.

- **Loop Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (x < 100000000)`
  - **Operations Performed**: 
    - If `x < 10000000`, increment `x` by 1.
    - Otherwise, increment `x` by 2.
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` is the only variable, initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Before the loop begins, `x = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: `x = 1` (incremented by 1)
  - **Iteration 2**: `x = 2` (incremented by 1)
  - **Iteration 3**: `x = 3` (incremented by 1)
  - **Iteration 4**: `x = 4` (incremented by 1)
  - **Iteration 5**: `x = 5` (incremented by 1)

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - The loop will not terminate within the first five iterations. It will terminate when `x >= 100000000`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**: `(x % 2)`. This asserts that `x` is odd when the loop terminates.

- **Analysis**:
  - The verification goal `(x % 2)` is not directly usable as a loop invariant because it only needs to be true at termination, not during all iterations.
  - **Modification for Invariant**:
    - A suitable invariant is: "If `x < 10000000`, then `x` is even; if `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd."
    - **Establishment**: Initially, `x = 0`, which is even.
    - **Preservation**: 
      - If `x < 10000000`, `x` is incremented by 1, keeping it even until `x` reaches 10000000.
      - If `x >= 10000000`, `x` is incremented by 2, maintaining its oddness.
    - **Termination**: When `x >= 100000000`, `x` must be odd.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**:
  - "If `x < 10000000`, then `x` is even; if `x >= 10000000`, then `x` is odd."

- **Explanation**:
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - Initially, `x = 0`, which is even.
    - When `x < 10000000`, it is incremented by 1, keeping it even until it reaches 10000000.
    - Once `x >= 10000000`, it is incremented by 2, maintaining its oddness.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment Explanation**:
  - Before the loop starts, `x = 0`, which is even. Therefore, the invariant holds.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation Explanation**:
  - If `x < 10000000`, incrementing by 1 keeps `x` even.
  - If `x >= 10000000`, incrementing by 2 keeps `x` odd.
  - Thus, the invariant is preserved through each iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State**:
  - The loop terminates when `x >= 100000000`.
  - At termination, `x` is odd because it was incremented by 2 in the range `x >= 10000000`.

- **Invariant Validity**:
  - The invariant holds as `x` is odd when the loop terminates.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation**:
  - The post-condition `(x % 2)` is correct.
  - The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x >= 100000000`), implies that `x` is odd, satisfying the post-condition.

2025-12-22 19:04:42,876 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `x == 0`

Loop program: `

void foo303() {

    unsigned int x;

    x = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

          PLACE_HOLDER_LOOP
            */
            while (x < 100000000) {
       if (x < 10000000) {
       x++;
      }
       else {
       x += 2;
      }
      }
            

    /*@ assert (x % 2); */

The errors indicate that the current loop invariant `x % 2 == 0` is incorrect. It fails to be preserved throughout the loop and does not help in verifying the postcondition that `x` is odd after the loop terminates. Additionally, the assertion `/*@ assert (x % 2); */` fails, which means that the postcondition cannot be implied by the current invariants. The invariant needs to be regenerated to accurately reflect the properties of `x` during and after the loop execution.
