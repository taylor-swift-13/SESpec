#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure ####

- **Purpose**: The loop in this code snippet is designed to modify the value of the variable `c` based on certain conditions. The loop continues executing as long as the function `unknown()` returns true. Within the loop, `c` is incremented or reset based on specific conditions related to `c` and `n`.

- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: The loop is governed by the condition `while(unknown())`, which means the loop will continue executing as long as the `unknown()` function returns a non-zero value (interpreted as true in C).
  - **Operations**:
    - If `unknown()` returns true, and `c > n`, then `c` is incremented by 1.
    - If `unknown()` returns false, and `c == n`, then `c` is reset to 1.
  - **Relevant Variables**: The variables relevant to the loop's behavior are `c` and `n`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values ####

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `c = 0`
  - `n` is a positive integer as per the pre-condition `n > 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: 
    - If `unknown()` is true and `c > n`, `c` becomes 1 (since `c` is initially 0, this condition does not hold).
    - If `unknown()` is false and `c == n`, `c` becomes 1 (this condition does not hold initially).
  - **Iteration 2**:
    - Similar conditions apply, with `c` possibly incrementing or resetting based on `unknown()` and the value of `c`.
  - **Iteration 3, 4, 5**:
    - The behavior continues similarly, with `c` potentially changing based on the conditions within the loop.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - The loop will terminate when `unknown()` returns false. The final value of `c` will depend on the sequence of `unknown()` evaluations and the conditions met during iterations.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis ####

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition to be proven is `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)`.
- **Can it be used as an invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The post-condition `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)` is trivially true because `n > -1` is always true given the pre-condition `n > 0`. It does not provide useful information during iterations.
- **Modification for Invariant**:
  - A possible invariant could be `c <= n`. This captures the essence that `c` should not exceed `n` unless incremented by the loop logic.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion ####

- **Proposed Invariant**: `c <= n`
- **Explanation**: This invariant holds because:
  - Initially, `c = 0`, which satisfies `c <= n`.
  - During iterations, `c` is incremented only if `c > n`, which implies `c` does not exceed `n` unless incremented.
  - The invariant `c <= n` is maintained through the loop iterations.

#### e. Establishment ####

- **Establishment**: The invariant `c <= n` is established before the first iteration because `c` is initialized to 0, and `n` is positive (`n > 0`), thus `c <= n` holds true.

#### f. Preservation ####

- **Preservation**: During each iteration:
  - If `unknown()` is true and `c > n`, `c` is incremented, but this condition is not initially met, so `c <= n` holds.
  - If `unknown()` is false and `c == n`, `c` is reset to 1, maintaining `c <= n`.
  - Therefore, if `c <= n` holds at the start of an iteration, it will still hold at the end of that iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis ####

- **Termination State**: When the loop terminates, `unknown()` returns false. The invariant `c <= n` remains valid because:
  - The loop conditions ensure `c` does not exceed `n` unless incremented due to specific logic, and even if `c == n`, it resets to 1, maintaining `c <= n`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness ####

- **Post-condition Evaluation**: The post-condition `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)` is correct but trivial given the pre-condition `n > 0`.
- **Proof with Invariant**: The invariant `c <= n` combined with the termination condition (`unknown()` is false) ensures that the loop does not violate the post-condition logic. Since `n > 0`, the implication `(c == n) ==> (n > -1)` is always true.

In summary, the loop invariant `c <= n` is valid, established, preserved, and supports the trivial post-condition given the pre-condition `n > 0`.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 16:42:20,734 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (c == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */

    int c = 0;
