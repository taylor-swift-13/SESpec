2025-12-22 19:17:31,444 - INFO  - think in natural language: Let's perform a detailed analysis of the given C code snippet, focusing on the loop and its invariants.

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**: The loop's purpose is to increment the variable `sn` by 1 for each iteration, effectively counting from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` is also incremented by 1 in each iteration to track the current step and control the loop's execution.

- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (i <= n)`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
  - **Operations**:
    - `i = i + 1;` increments `i` by 1.
    - `sn = sn + 1;` increments `sn` by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables**:
    - `i`: Controls the number of iterations.
    - `sn`: Accumulates the number of iterations.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `i = 1`
  - `sn = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **After 1st Iteration**: `i = 2`, `sn = 1`
  - **After 2nd Iteration**: `i = 3`, `sn = 2`
  - **After 3rd Iteration**: `i = 4`, `sn = 3`
  - **After 4th Iteration**: `i = 5`, `sn = 4`
  - **After 5th Iteration**: `i = 6`, `sn = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling** (if `n = 5`):
  - Loop terminates as `i = 6` which is greater than `n = 5`.
  - Final values: `i = 6`, `sn = 5`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition `assert (sn != n) ==> (sn == 0);` needs to be proven.
  
- **Analysis**:
  - The post-condition states that if `sn` is not equal to `n`, then `sn` should be 0. This implies that if the loop runs completely (i.e., `i` reaches `n+1`), then `sn` should equal `n`. Otherwise, `sn` should remain 0, which would only happen if the loop doesn't execute (not possible here as `n >= 1`).

- **Invariant Suitability**:
  - The verification goal itself cannot be used as an invariant because it pertains to the state after the loop has terminated, not during its execution.
  
- **Modification for Invariant**:
  - A suitable invariant could be `sn == i - 1`, which holds true during the loop execution.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `sn == i - 1`
  
- **Explanation**:
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - Before the loop starts (`i = 1`), `sn = 0`, so `sn == i - 1` holds.
    - Each iteration increments both `i` and `sn` by 1, maintaining the relationship `sn == i - 1`.

### e. Establishment

- **Invariant Establishment**:
  - Initially, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, so `sn == i - 1` is `0 == 1 - 1`, which is true.
  - The pre-condition `n >= 1` ensures the loop can execute at least once, starting with the invariant holding true.

### f. Preservation

- **Invariant Preservation**:
  - Assume `sn == i - 1` holds at the start of an iteration.
  - After executing `i = i + 1; sn = sn + 1;`, we have:
    - New `i = old_i + 1`
    - New `sn = old_sn + 1`
    - Thus, `new_sn = new_i - 1` holds, preserving the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Termination State**:
  - The loop terminates when `i > n`.
  - At termination, `i = n + 1` and `sn = n`.
  - The invariant `sn == i - 1` still holds as `sn = n` and `i = n + 1`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation**:
  - The post-condition `(sn != n) ==> (sn == 0)` is correct.
  - When the loop terminates, `sn` equals `n`, so the condition `sn != n` is false, making the implication true by default.
  - The invariant `sn == i - 1`, combined with `i > n`, implies `sn == n`, satisfying the post-condition.

In conclusion, the loop invariant `sn == i - 1` is established, preserved, and leads to the post-condition being satisfied upon loop termination.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.
