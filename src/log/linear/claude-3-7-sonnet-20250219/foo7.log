## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop increments both `x` and `y` by 10 repeatedly as long as the condition `unknown()` returns true.
- The function expects the input variables `x` and `y` to be between 0 and 10 inclusive at entry.
- After the loop terminates, there is an assertion stating: if `x` is exactly 20, then `y` must be nonzero.
- Intuitively, the loop is meant to "advance" both variables simultaneously in steps of 10, up to some unspecified termination condition.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while (unknown())` — unknown behavior, but presumably some boolean condition controlling loop exit. We cannot assume anything concrete about its behavior.
- **Operations inside loop:** 
  - `x = x + 10;`
  - `y = y + 10;`
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `x` and `y` are both integers starting within [0, 10].
  - They are modified identically at each iteration, increased by 10.
- The loop body does not modify any other variables.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Because `unknown()` is unspecified, we cannot know exactly how many loop iterations will execute. Still, we analyze how `x` and `y` evolve after successive iterations if the loop runs that many times.

Given precondition: 
- Initially, `0 ≤ x ≤ 10`
- Initially, `0 ≤ y ≤ 10`

Let's denote iteration counts from 0 (before loop) upwards.

| Iteration | x value                 | y value                 |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 0 (pre)  | x₀ ∈ [0,10]             | y₀ ∈ [0,10]             |
| 1        | x₁ = x₀ + 10 ∈ [10, 20]| y₁ = y₀ + 10 ∈ [10, 20]|
| 2        | x₂ = x₁ + 10 ∈ [20, 30]| y₂ = y₁ + 10 ∈ [20, 30]|
| 3        | x₃ = x₂ + 10 ∈ [30, 40]| y₃ = y₂ + 10 ∈ [30, 40]|
| 4        | x₄ = x₃ + 10 ∈ [40, 50]| y₄ = y₃ + 10 ∈ [40, 50]|
| 5        | x₅ = x₄ + 10 ∈ [50, 60]| y₅ = y₄ + 10 ∈ [50, 60]|

- Variables increase in lockstep by 10 at every iteration.
- The difference between `x` and `y` remains constant:
  
  \[
  (x_n - y_n) = (x_0 - y_0)
  \]

because

\[
x_n = x_0 + 10n, \quad y_n = y_0 + 10 n \implies x_n - y_n = x_0 - y_0.
\]

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert (x == 20) ==> (y != 0); */
```

- Meaning: If `x` equals exactly 20 at the end, then `y` must not be zero.
- This is a conditional property applied after loop termination.

**Can this serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- **No, directly**:
  - The condition `(x == 20)` will not generally hold during all iterations. For instance, if `x=0` initially, after first iteration `x=10`, second iteration `x=20`.
  - But the invariant must hold *before and after every iteration*, so containing a rigid equality like `x == 20` will fail in most iterations (e.g., at iteration 1, `x=10`).
- The post-condition is more of a *termination property* rather than an iterative invariant.

**Can we modify it into a suitable invariant?**

- We want a property related to `x`, `y` that holds always and implies the post-condition when loop terminates.
- Key observation: difference between `x` and `y` remains invariant:

\[
x - y = x_0 - y_0
\]

- Since initial precondition bounds \(x_0, y_0\) in [0,10], `x_0 - y_0` ∈ [-10, 10].
- Also, if at termination `x == 20`, then:

\[
y = x - (x_0 - y_0) = 20 - (x_0 - y_0)
\]

- For `y` to be zero, would require:

\[
0 = y = 20 - (x_0 - y_0) \implies x_0 - y_0 = 20,
\]

which is impossible given initial bounds.

Therefore, the invariant can be expressed as:

```c
x - y == x0 - y0
```

(where `x0` and `y0` are the initial values of `x` and `y`).

From this, the post-condition follows naturally because if `x == 20`, `y` cannot be zero given the initial bounds.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Invariant (Natural Language):**

At the start and end of every loop iteration, the difference between `x` and `y` remains constant and equal to their initial difference:

> _"The difference between `x` and `y` does not change during the loop and equals its initial value."_

Formally:

\[
\boxed{x - y = x_0 - y_0}
\]

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Each loop iteration increases both `x` and `y` by the same amount (10).
- So the increment cancels out in the difference.
- This difference is established before the loop starts and preserved after every iteration.
- This invariant restricts `x` and `y`’s possible values jointly, tightly coupling their values through the iteration.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established?**

- Before the first iteration, the difference `x - y` equals the initial difference `x_0 - y_0` by definition.
- The precondition guarantees initial `x` and `y` values satisfy:

\[
0 \leq x_0 \leq 10, \quad 0 \leq y_0 \leq 10.
\]

- Thus, the initial difference is some integer between \(-10\) and \(10\).

- Since the loop has not executed yet, the invariant:

\[
x - y = x_0 - y_0
\]

holds trivially.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved?**

Suppose at the start of iteration \(i\), the invariant holds:

\[
x_i - y_i = x_0 - y_0.
\]

During iteration \(i\):

- The loop body executes:

\[
x_{i+1} = x_i + 10,
\]
\[
y_{i+1} = y_i + 10.
\]

Then:

\[
x_{i+1} - y_{i+1} = (x_i + 10) - (y_i + 10) = x_i - y_i = x_0 - y_0.
\]

So the invariant holds at the end of iteration \(i\).

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- The loop ends when `unknown()` returns false.
- Since we cannot control or analyze `unknown()`, we treat termination as an unknown state.
- However, the invariant remains true at termination because it holds at end of all iterations.
- At loop exit, invariant:

\[
x - y = x_0 - y_0
\]

still holds.

- We also know from preconditions that \(0 \leq x_0, y_0 \leq 10\), so:

\[
x_0 - y_0 \in [-10,10].
\]

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**

```c
assert (x == 20) ==> (y != 0);
```

- If \(x=20\), then from the invariant:

\[
y = x - (x_0 - y_0) = 20 - (x_0 - y_0).
\]

- For \(y=0\), this implies:

\[
0 = 20 - (x_0 - y_0) \Rightarrow x_0 - y_0 = 20,
\]

which is impossible since \(x_0 - y_0 \in [-10,10]\).

- Therefore \(y \neq 0\) always holds if \(x=20\).

**Conclusion:**

- The invariant in conjunction with initial bounds imply the post-condition.
- More explicitly:

\[
\text{LoopInvariant} \wedge \neg unknown() \implies (x == 20 \to y \neq 0)
\]

because if \(x =20\), \(y\) cannot be zero due to bounded initial conditions and invariant difference.

# **Summary of the Formal Invariant Analysis**

| Step            | Explanation                                                                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Invariant:**  | \(x - y = x_0 - y_0\)                                                                  |
| **Establishment:** | Holds before first iteration since \(x=x_0, y=y_0\).                                    |
| **Preservation:** | Both \(x\) and \(y\) incremented equally, so difference remains constant.                |
| **Termination:** | On loop exit, invariant still holds.                                                  |
| **Post-condition:** | If \(x=20\), \(y \neq 0\) because initial difference cannot be 20, hence \(y\) cannot be zero. |

# **Suggested Code Annotation with Loop Invariant:**

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant x - y == \old(x) - \old(y);
  loop assigns x, y;
*/
while (unknown()) {
    x = x + 10;
    y = y + 10;
}
```

- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) >= 0 && \at(x,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) >= 0 && (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x >= 0 && x <= 10 && y <= 10 && y >= 0;
    */
    
void foo7(int x, int y) {
  
  
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */

2025-12-23 05:18:38,525 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) >= 0 && \at(x,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) >= 0 && (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x >= 0 && x <= 10 && y <= 10 && y >= 0;
    */
    
void foo7(int x, int y) {
  
  
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
