## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose**: The loop decrements both `x` and `y` simultaneously until `x` reaches 0. Since `x` is initialized to `y`, the loop effectively reduces both variables by the same amount (the initial value of `y`), bringing `x` to 0 and `y` to 0.

**Structure**:
- **Loop Condition**: `while (x != 0)` - continues as long as `x` is not equal to 0
- **Loop Body**: 
  - `x = x - 1;` - decrements `x` by 1
  - `y = y - 1;` - decrements `y` by 1
- **Relevant Variables**:
  - `y`: Input parameter with precondition `y >= 0`
  - `x`: Local variable initialized to the value of `y` before the loop

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's trace execution with a concrete example where the initial value of `y` is 3:

| Sample Point | x | y | Loop Condition (x != 0) |
|--------------|---|---|------------------------|
| **Pre-Loop** (after `x = y;`) | 3 | 3 | true |
| **After Iteration 1** | 2 | 2 | true |
| **After Iteration 2** | 1 | 1 | true |
| **After Iteration 3** | 0 | 0 | false |
| **Post-Loop** | 0 | 0 | N/A |

*Note: The loop terminates after 3 iterations for this example (initial y=3), so iterations 4 and 5 do not occur.*

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal**: `y == 0` (the post-condition)

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**

**NO** - The verification goal `y == 0` cannot be directly used as the loop invariant.

**Why?** 
- The condition `y == 0` is only true when the loop terminates, not during the loop's execution
- From our sampling: at the start and during iterations, `y` takes values 3, 2, 1, etc., which are not equal to 0
- A loop invariant must be true at the beginning and end of *every* iteration, but `y == 0` is only true after the final iteration

**Can we modify it to create a valid invariant?**

**YES** - We need to establish a relationship that holds throughout all iterations.

**Proposed Modification**:
Instead of requiring `y == 0`, we should capture the relationship between `x` and `y` that remains constant throughout execution. From our sampling, we observe that `x` and `y` always have the same value: `x == y`.

This modified invariant:
- **Establishment**: Holds initially because `x` is assigned the value of `y`
- **Preservation**: Both variables are decremented by 1 in each iteration, maintaining equality
- **Termination**: When the loop exits (`x == 0`), combined with `x == y`, we can conclude `y == 0`

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant** (in natural language):
"The value of `x` equals the value of `y` at the beginning and end of every loop iteration."

**Formal Notation**: `x == y`

**Validation against sampling**:

| Sample Point | x | y | Invariant (x == y) |
|--------------|---|---|-------------------|
| Pre-Loop | 3 | 3 | ✓ true |
| After Iteration 1 | 2 | 2 | ✓ true |
| After Iteration 2 | 1 | 1 | ✓ true |
| After Iteration 3 | 0 | 0 | ✓ true |
| Post-Loop | 0 | 0 | ✓ true |

**Why this invariant is valid**:

1. The invariant `x == y` holds before the loop begins because `x` is explicitly assigned the value of `y`
2. In each iteration, both `x` and `y` are decremented by exactly 1, so their equality is preserved
3. The invariant remains true throughout all sampled iterations and at loop termination
4. Combined with the loop termination condition (`x == 0`), it directly implies the post-condition (`y == 0`)

## e. Establishment

**Initial State**:
- **Pre-condition**: `y >= 0` (given)
- **Before loop**: The statement `x = y;` executes, assigning `x` the value of `y`

**Establishment of Invariant**:
After the assignment `x = y;`, both variables hold the same value. Therefore, `x == y` is trivially true before the first iteration begins.

**Formal reasoning**:
```
Given: y >= 0 (precondition)
After: x = y
Therefore: x == y (invariant established)
```

## f. Preservation

**Assumption**: At the start of an arbitrary iteration, assume:
- The invariant `x == y` holds
- The loop condition `x != 0` is true

**Loop Body Execution**:
1. `x = x - 1;` → Let's call the new value `x'`, so `x' = x - 1`
2. `y = y - 1;` → Let's call the new value `y'`, so `y' = y - 1`

**Proving Invariant After Loop Body**:
We need to show that `x' == y'`.

```
Given: x == y (invariant at start)
After step 1: x' = x - 1
After step 2: y' = y - 1

Since x == y, we have:
x' = x - 1 = y - 1 = y'

Therefore: x' == y' (invariant preserved)
```

The invariant is maintained through each iteration because both variables are modified identically (both decremented by 1).

## g. Termination Analysis

**Termination Condition**: The loop exits when `x == 0` (i.e., when `x != 0` becomes false).

**State at Termination**:
- `x == 0` (negation of loop condition)
- `x == y` (loop invariant still holds)

**Why the invariant remains valid**:
The loop invariant `x == y` is not affected by the loop condition becoming false. The invariant was preserved through all iterations and continues to hold when the loop terminates. The final iteration decrements both `x` and `y` to 0, maintaining their equality.

**Variable states at termination**:
- `x = 0`
- `y = 0` (because `x == y` and `x = 0`)

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition**: `y == 0`

**Is the post-condition correct?** **YES**

**Proof**:

At loop termination, we have:
1. Loop condition is false: `!(x != 0)` which means `x == 0`
2. Loop invariant holds: `x == y`

From (1) and (2):
```
x == 0 ∧ x == y
⟹ y == 0
```

Therefore, the post-condition `y == 0` is correct and is logically implied by the combination of the loop invariant and the negation of the loop condition.

**Complete Verification Summary**:
```
Precondition: y >= 0
Invariant: x == y
Loop terminates when: x == 0
At termination: x == 0 ∧ x == y ⟹ y == 0
Post-condition: y == 0 ✓
```

The verification is complete and sound.
