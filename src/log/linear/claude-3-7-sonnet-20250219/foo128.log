### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**

The loop repeatedly doubles the integer variable `x` starting from 1, until `x` is no longer less than the input parameter `y`. The intended outcome is that upon loop termination, `x` will be some power of two that is **greater than or equal to `y`** (or at least `x >= y`).

**Structure:**

- Governing condition: `while (x < y)`
  - The loop continues iterating as long as `x` is strictly less than `y`.
- Loop body: `x = x + x;`
  - The variable `x` is doubled each iteration.
- Relevant variables:
  - `x`: initialized to 1 before entering the loop, updated by doubling each iteration.
  - `y`: loop boundary input, fixed during execution, not changed inside the loop.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Iteration | `x` Value Before Iteration | Operation      | `x` Value After Iteration |
|-----------|----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Pre-loop  | 1                          | —              | —                         |
| 1         | 1                          | `x = 1 + 1`    | 2                         |
| 2         | 2                          | `x = 2 + 2`    | 4                         |
| 3         | 4                          | `x = 4 + 4`    | 8                         |
| 4         | 8                          | `x = 8 + 8`    | 16                        |
| 5         | 16                         | `x = 16 + 16`  | 32                        |

- Each iteration doubles `x`.
- The loop will terminate once `x >= y` (loop condition `x < y` becomes false).
- Number of iterations depends on the input `y`.

If the loop terminates before 5 iterations (e.g., if `y` is small), the termination sample would be taken at that moment.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition)**:

```c
/*@ assert x >= 1; */
```

- This states that after the loop, `x` is at least 1.

**Can this post-condition be part of the loop invariant?**

- **Yes and no**:

  - Yes, `x >= 1` is true after the loop since `x` starts at 1 and is always doubled (always positive and ≥1).
  - But `x >= 1` is a very weak condition compared to the actual behavior of the loop — it does not capture the meaningful relationship between `x` and `y`.
  - The loop condition and behavior suggest a stronger and more useful invariant involving the relationship between `x` and `y`.

**Is `x >= 1` useful as an invariant?**

- Yes, as a minimal base condition it's trivially true before and after the loop.
  
**However, can it be strengthened to create a useful loop invariant?**

- Yes. A better invariant would reflect that `x` is always a power of two and that `x` remains less than or equal to some bound related to `y` during iterations.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (informal):**

- "`x` is always a power of two (i.e., `x = 2^k` for some integer `k ≥ 0`) and `x` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `y` or possibly slightly greater during the last iteration."

More specifically during the loop:

- For every iteration where `x < y`, `x` equals some power of two, with `x ≥ 1`.

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Initially, `x = 1`, which is `2^0`.
- Each loop iteration doubles `x`, which multiplies it by 2 — so `x` remains a power of two.
- The loop proceeds as long as `x < y`, so while the loop executes, `x` is strictly less than `y`.
- On termination, `x` will be at least `y` (no longer less than `y`).
- The invariant captures the binary growth pattern of `x` and bounds relative to `y`.

---

### e. Establishment

**How is the invariant initially established?**

- Before the first iteration:
  - `x = 1`
  - 1 is `2^0`, a power of two.
  - Since this is before loop starts, `x` trivially satisfies:
    - `x` is a power of two.
    - `x >= 1`.
- Therefore, the invariant holds prior to entering the loop.

---

### f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved after each iteration?**

- Assume invariant holds at start of an iteration:
  - `x` is a power of two (say `2^k` for some `k >= 0`).
  - `x` < `y` (loop condition true).
- The operation inside the loop is `x = x + x` ⇒ `x = 2 * x = 2^(k+1)`.
- Doubling a power of two results in another power of two.
- Resulting `x` is still a power of two.
- Also, because the loop condition is `x < y`, presumably after doubling, `x` will be updated.
- If the loop continues to the next iteration, the new `x` again satisfies the invariant.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**When does the loop terminate?**

- When `x < y` becomes false.
- That means `x >= y`.
- Because the invariant guarantees `x` is a power of two and `x >= 1`, and doubling only increased `x`, the final `x` satisfies:
  - `x >= y`
  - `x` is a power of two.
  
The invariant remains valid at termination:

- Since `x` is power of two and initialized ≥1, and `x >= y` at termination, the invariant and termination condition jointly imply properties about `x` relative to `y`.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Is the post-condition `x >= 1` correct?**

- Yes, trivially correct — since `x` starts at 1 and only doubles.
- However, it is weak compared to what loop behavior guarantees.

**Does the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition prove the post-condition?**

- Loop terminates when `!(x < y)`, i.e., when `x >= y`.
- The invariant guarantees `x >= 1`.
- Therefore, the post-condition (`x >= 1`) is trivially satisfied after termination.

---

## Summary and Suggested Invariant Annotation

### Natural language loop invariant:

- *"At the start of each iteration and after each iteration, `x` is a positive power of two (`x = 2^k` for some `k >= 0`) and `x >= 1` holds. Moreover, while the loop executes, `x < y`."*

### Possible formal annotation snippet (using ACSL-like syntax for illustration):

```c
/*@
  loop invariant x >= 1;
  loop invariant (exists integer k; k >= 0 && x == (1 << k));
  loop invariant x <= y;
@*/
```

This indicates:

- `x >= 1` (established and preserved).
- `x` remains a power of two (expressed via bit shift).
- `x` does not overshoot `y` during the loop (while condition true for the loop iterations).

If there are constraints in the verification tool about existential quantifiers, one can encode the power-of-two property alternatively (e.g., using bitwise operations):

```c
/*@
  loop invariant x >= 1;
  loop invariant (x & (x - 1)) == 0; // x is power of two
  loop invariant x <= y;
@*/
```

This is a well-known bit trick: powers of two have exactly one bit set, so `x & (x-1) == 0`.

---

### Explanation

- The loop invariant is **established** before the first iteration since `x=1` which is a power of two.
- It is **preserved** because doubling a power of two remains a power of two, and the loop condition `x < y` ensures the values remain bounded appropriately.
- **At termination**, `x >= y` and `x` is still a power of two.
- This invariant framework implies the given post-condition `x >= 1`.

- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo128(int y) {

    int x = 1;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (1 < \at(y,Pre)) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL);
          loop invariant (1 < \at(y,Pre)) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;
          loop invariant (!(1 < \at(y,Pre))) ==> ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y,Pre)));
          loop invariant y == \at(y,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (x < y) {
  
       x  = x + x ;
       
    }
            
  
    /*@ assert x >= 1;*/
  
  }`
