---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

### Purpose and Intended Outcome

The loop operates on two unsigned integer variables, `x` and `y`, and repeatedly modifies `x` and `y` based on the remainder of `x` modulo 3 (`x % 3`) and a nondeterministic condition `unknown()`. The overall aim appears to be a process that repeatedly increments `x` by some amount (1, 2, 4, or 5), while setting `y` to either 0 or 1 depending on the specific branch taken.

The key post-condition associated with the loop is:

```c
(y == 0) ==> (x % 3 == 0)
```

which means: **if `y` is 0, then `x` is divisible by 3** at the conclusion of the loop.

Intuitively, the loop is trying to maintain or establish a relationship between `y` and the divisibility of `x` by 3.

### Loop Structure

- The loop is a `while` loop, governed by a nondeterministic function `unknown()`. It runs as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- Inside the loop body:
  - If `x % 3 == 1`:
    - `x` increases by 2
    - `y` becomes 0
  - Else if `x % 3 == 2`:
    - `x` increases by 1
    - `y` becomes 0
  - Else (`x % 3 == 0`):
    - If `unknown()` returns true:
      - `x` increases by 4
      - `y` becomes 1
    - Else:
      - `x` increases by 5
      - `y` becomes 1

Variables involved:

- `x`: unsigned int, modified every iteration, increments vary by branch.
- `y`: unsigned int, set to either 0 or 1 each iteration, based on `x % 3` and boolean conditions.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Because `x` is initially **uninitialized**, its initial value is unknown and hence difficult to predict concrete values precisely. The function `unknown()` also returns nondeterministic boolean values, so analyses will focus on modular arithmetic properties and branch consequences rather than specific values.

### Pre-Loop Sampling (Before first iteration):

- `x`: unknown initial value, denoted as `x0`.
- `y`: initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

### Post-Iteration Sampling: We symbolically analyze how `x % 3` and `y` evolve.

Recall that all updates are additions to `x`, and we focus on `x % 3` values and `y`:

- If `x % 3 == 1`:

  ```
  x = x + 2;
  y = 0;
  After update:
  (x % 3) = (1 + 2) % 3 = 0
  y = 0
  ```

- If `x % 3 == 2`:

  ```
  x = x + 1;
  y = 0;
  After update:
  (x % 3) = (2 + 1) % 3 = 0
  y = 0
  ```

- If `x % 3 == 0`:

  Two subcases depending on `unknown()`:

  - If `unknown()` is true:

    ```
    x = x + 4;
    y = 1;
    (x % 3) = (0 + 4) % 3 = 1
    y = 1
    ```

  - Else (`unknown()` false):

    ```
    x = x + 5;
    y = 1;
    (x % 3) = (0 + 5) % 3 = 2
    y = 1
    ```

---

### Summary of modular transitions and `y` settings:

| Before Iteration     | Action                        | After Iteration              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| x % 3 == 0          | if unknown()==true: x+=4,y=1  | x % 3 == 1, y == 1          |
| x % 3 == 0          | else: x+=5,y=1                | x % 3 == 2, y == 1          |
| x % 3 == 1          | x += 2; y = 0                | x % 3 == 0, y == 0          |
| x % 3 == 2          | x += 1; y = 0                | x % 3 == 0, y == 0          |

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

### Verification Goal (Post-Condition) To Prove:

```c
(y == 0) ==> (x % 3 == 0);
```

Read as: *if y equals zero, then x must be divisible by 3*.

---

### Can the verification goal be a loop invariant?

- **Is `(y == 0) ==> (x % 3 == 0)` true before the first iteration?**

  - Initially, `y` is set to 1 (before loop starts).
  - When `y == 1`, the implication `(y == 0) ==> (x % 3 == 0)` is vacuously true.
  - So establishment is trivially satisfied before the first iteration.

- **Is it preserved during each iteration?**

  Examine the loop body transitions in terms of `(y == 0) ==> (x % 3 == 0)`.

  - From the table above, when `y == 0`, the new value of `x % 3` is **always 0**.
  - When `y == 1`, the implication is vacuously true regardless of `x % 3`.
  - Each iteration ensures that when `y` is 0, `x % 3` is 0.
  
- **Is the goal true at termination (when `unknown()` is false)?**

  The invariant maintains the property throughout iterations, and the post-condition holds at termination.

Thus, **YES**, the verification goal itself can be used as a loop invariant directly.

---

### No modification is needed for the invariant. The verification goal is a valid invariant candidate.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language):

**At the beginning and end of every iteration of the loop, if `y` equals 0 then the value of `x` is divisible by 3; formally:**

```
(y == 0) ⇒ (x % 3 == 0)
```

---

### Why is this invariant valid?

The transitions on `x` and `y` ensure this invariant remains true:

- Whenever `y` is set to 0, it is immediately after modifying `x` so that `x % 3 == 0`.
- Whenever `y` is set to 1, no particular condition on `x % 3` is guaranteed, but the implication is vacuously true when `y != 0`.
- The invariant is true before the first iteration as `y` is initially 1.
- The invariant is maintained through all branches and updates inside the loop.
- Therefore, the invariant is inductive: established initially, preserved across iterations, and true at loop termination.

---

## e. Establishment

- **Initial values before the loop:**

  - `y = 1` (explicit initialization before loop)
  - `x` is unknown (not explicitly initialized)

- **Does the invariant hold before the first iteration?**

  The invariant states `(y == 0) => (x % 3 == 0)`.

- Since `y = 1` initially, the implication is vacuously true (antecedent false ⇒ the implication true).

- So the invariant is established prior to entering the loop.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration:

  ```
  (y == 0) ⇒ (x % 3 == 0)
  ```

- Now analyze each branch in the loop body to ensure the invariant holds at the end of the iteration:

| Branch Condition | Update to x       | Update to y | x % 3 after update | y after update | Does invariant hold?                                  |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| x % 3 == 1       | x += 2           | y = 0       | (1 + 2) % 3 = 0    | 0              | x % 3 == 0 when y == 0 ⇒ holds                     |
| x % 3 == 2       | x += 1           | y = 0       | (2 + 1) % 3 = 0    | 0              | x % 3 == 0 when y == 0 ⇒ holds                     |
| x % 3 == 0 and unknown()==true | x += 4           | y = 1       | (0 + 4) % 3 = 1    | 1              | y == 1 ⇒ antecedent false ⇒ invariant vacuously true |
| x % 3 == 0 and unknown()==false| x += 5           | y = 1       | (0 + 5) % 3 = 2    | 1              | y == 1 ⇒ antecedent false ⇒ invariant vacuously true |

- After each update, when `y` is zero, `x % 3` is zero. When `y` equals 1, the antecedent of the implication `(y == 0)` is false so the invariant holds trivially.

- Therefore, **preservation condition is satisfied**.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates the first time `unknown()` returns false in the outer `while` condition.

- At this point, the invariant holds, i.e. `(y == 0) ⇒ (x % 3 == 0)` is true.

- There is no additional state needed to consider because the invariant explicitly covers all reachable states of `(x,y)` at loop exit.

- Hence, the invariant remains valid at loop termination.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition is:

  ```c
  (y == 0) ==> (x % 3 == 0);
  ```

- Based on the loop invariant and the termination condition (loop exits when `unknown() == false`), the post-condition holds correctly:

  - The loop invariant guarantees `(y == 0) ⇒ (x % 3 == 0)` at every loop iteration.
  - When the loop finishes, the invariant still holds because it is preserved each iteration.
  - Therefore, at post-loop point, the post-condition is guaranteed to be true.

---

# **Summary:**

| Aspect     | Explanation/Result                                             |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loop purpose | Repeatedly update `x` and set `y` such that `(y==0) => (x%3==0)`. |
| Precondition| `y = 1` initially; `x` unknown.                                |
| Loop invariant | `(y == 0) ⇒ (x % 3 == 0)` is true before and after each iteration. |
| Establishment | Holds before loop because `y=1`, implication vacuously true.  |
| Preservation | In each branch, `y=0` only occurs when `x % 3 == 0` after update, else `y=1`. |
| Termination | Loop exit preserves invariant, so post-condition holds.        |
| Post-condition | The given post-condition is correct and follows from invariant. |

2025-12-23 02:13:25,363 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(y == 1) * undef_data_at(&x)`

Loop program: `


void foo243() {

    unsigned int x;
    unsigned int y;

    y = 1;
