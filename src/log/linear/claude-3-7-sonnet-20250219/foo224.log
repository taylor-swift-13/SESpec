### Original Code Snippet

```c
int unknown();
void foo224() {
    int x;
    x = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */
    while(unknown()) {
        x = x + 4;
    }

    /*@ assert x % 4 == 0; */
}
```

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The purpose of the loop is to repeatedly increment the integer variable `x` by 4 while an unspecified (unknown) condition holds true.
- The intended outcome is that when the loop terminates, `x` should be divisible by 4, as asserted by `x % 4 == 0`.
- Since `unknown()` is an external/opaque function returning some boolean-like value, we cannot predict the exact number of iterations or when the loop ends, only that it increments `x` by 4 each iteration.

**Loop Structure:**

- Governing condition: `while(unknown())` — the loop runs as long as `unknown()` returns true (non-zero).
- Loop body: increments `x` by 4 — `x = x + 4`.
- Relevant variables: 
  - `x`, initialized to 0 before loop.
  - The loop condition is nondeterministic, depending on the unknown function.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s simulate `x` values over up to 5 iterations, assuming `unknown()` returns true initially and eventually false:

| Stage                  | `x` value        | Reasoning                          |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Pre-Loop Initial**    | `x = 0`          | Initialization                   |
| After Iteration 1       | `x = 0 + 4 = 4`  | First increment                  |
| After Iteration 2       | `x = 4 + 4 = 8`  | Second increment                 |
| After Iteration 3       | `x = 8 + 4 = 12` | Third increment                  |
| After Iteration 4       | `x = 12 + 4 = 16`| Fourth increment                 |
| After Iteration 5       | `x = 16 + 4 = 20`| Fifth increment                  |
| Post-Loop termination   | Some `x = 4*k`   | For some `k ≥ 0` depending on loops |

Observations:

- The value of `x` always remains a multiple of 4.
- The initial value `0` is also a multiple of 4.
- Every iteration adds 4 to `x`, preserving divisibility by 4.
- Since `unknown()` is nondeterministic, the exact final value of `x` cannot be predicted, but the %4 property holds.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

```c
x % 4 == 0;
```

Meaning: Upon loop termination, `x` must be divisible by 4.

**Can this be part of the loop invariant?**

- **Yes**, because:
  - It holds initially (`x = 0`).
  - After each iteration, adding 4 maintains divisibility by 4.
  - It's not just true at termination but also throughout the loop.

**If No (not in this case):**

- Hypothetically, for properties only true at termination, you’d need modifications. But here, it’s directly inductive and suitable.

Therefore, the verification goal itself can serve as a core component of the loop invariant.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

> At the beginning and end of every loop iteration, the variable `x` is always a multiple of 4.

**Formal representation (using annotation syntax):**

```c
/*@ loop invariant x % 4 == 0; */
```

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Initially, before the first iteration, `x` is 0, which is divisible by 4.
- Every iteration adds 4 to `x`, preserving divisibility by 4.
- Thus, divisibility by 4 is maintained throughout the entire loop execution.
- Because the increment expression is a multiple of 4, the modulo relation holds at all times.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established?**

- Before the loop begins, `x` is explicitly assigned 0 (`x = 0;`).
- Since 0 % 4 == 0, the invariant `x % 4 == 0` trivially holds before the first iteration.
- The pre-loop assignment acts as a precondition guaranteeing the invariant at loop entry.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved after each iteration?**

- Assuming the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `x % 4 == 0`),
- The loop body executes `x = x + 4;`.
- Since 4 % 4 == 0, adding 4 does not change the remainder modulo 4.
- Therefore, `(x + 4) % 4 == (x % 4 + 4 % 4) % 4 == (0 + 0) % 4 == 0`.
- The invariant `x % 4 == 0` holds true at the end of the iteration as well.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**State when the loop terminates:**

- The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.
- At this point, variable `x` holds some multiple of 4, say `4 * k` where `k ≥ 0`.
- Since invariant is preserved throughout, it still holds at termination.

**Validity of invariant upon termination:**

- The invariant `x % 4 == 0` remains true despite loop termination.
- Termination does not modify `x`, so the property remains valid.
- The termination condition combined with the invariant leads directly to the post-condition.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Is the post-condition correct?**

- Yes, the post-condition `assert x % 4 == 0;` is correct.

**How does the invariant and termination condition imply the post-condition?**

- Invariant guarantees `x % 4 == 0` holds on every iteration start/end.
- When the loop ends (i.e., `while(unknown())` condition is false),
- No further iterations modify `x`.
- Thus, the final state `x` satisfies `x % 4 == 0`.
- This directly proves the assertion is valid.

---

# **Summary / Final Annotation for Loop Invariant**

```c
/*@ loop invariant x % 4 == 0; */
while (unknown()) {
    x = x + 4;
}
```

This completes the full formal reasoning and justification for the loop and the post-condition assertion.
