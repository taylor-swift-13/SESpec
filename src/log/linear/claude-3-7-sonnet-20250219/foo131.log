---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose**:  
The loop tries to decrement three variables (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`) under certain conditions—specifically, it decrements all three by fixed amounts (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`, all initialized to 1) if both `x2` and `x3` remain positive.

Intuitively, this loop seems designed to continue reducing these variables until `x1` is no longer greater than zero. However, since decrements only happen if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` as well, the loop’s ability to reduce `x1` depends on the states of `x2` and `x3`.

**Loop structure**:

- **Condition:** `while (x1 > 0)` — the loop runs as long as `x1` is greater than zero.
- **Body:**
  - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` then:
    - Decrement `x1` by `d1` (1).
    - Decrement `x2` by `d2` (1).
    - Decrement `x3` by `d3` (1).
    
Variables relevant to the loop behavior:

- `x1`: controls loop continuation; initially 1.
- `x2`, `x3`: control whether the decrements happen each iteration.
- `d1`, `d2`, `d3`: decrement steps (all 1).
  
The loop stops once `x1 <= 0`. The code ensures that the decrements happen only when all three variables `x1, x2, x3` are positive (although the condition only checks `x2` and `x3`).

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Assuming the initial values are:

- `x1 = 1`
- `x2 =` input parameter (unknown)
- `x3 =` input parameter (unknown)

`d1 = d2 = d3 = 1` (constants).

Since `x2` and `x3` are function inputs, their initial values influence execution.

---

We consider two cases depending on initial inputs for clarity.

---

**Example Case 1**: Positive inputs that allow the loop to run.

Say `x2 = 3, x3 = 2` initially.

| Iteration | x1 before | x2 before | x3 before | Condition `x1>0`? | Body executed? (`x2>0 && x3>0`) | After iteration values |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 0 (pre)  | 1         | 3         | 2         | yes               | yes                          | (to be calculated)     |
| 1        | 1         | 3         | 2         | yes               | yes                          | x1=0, x2=2, x3=1      |
| 2        | 0         | 2         | 1         | no                | no                           | loop terminates        |

- Pre-loop sample:

  - `x1=1`, `x2=3`, `x3=2`
- Post iteration 1:

  - `x1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `x2 = 3 - 1 = 2`
  - `x3 = 2 - 1 = 1`
- Loop condition fails at `x1 = 0` → loop exits.

---

**Example Case 2**: If `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`, then no decrements happen.

Say `x2 = 0, x3 = 5`, `x1 = 1`.

- Pre loop: `x1=1, x2=0, x3=5`
- Loop condition `x1 > 0` holds, but `x2 > 0 && x3 > 0` is false → loop body does not reduce anything.
- The loop conditions are:

```c
while(x1 > 0) {
    if(x2 > 0) {
        if(x3 > 0) { ... }
    }
}
```

There is no change to any variable inside the loop if the nested conditions fail. So `x1` remains 1, infinite loop occurs.

---

**Overall sampling observations:**

- If initially `x2 > 0 && x3 > 0`, then each loop iteration reduces all three of `x1`, `x2`, `x3` by 1.
- The loop will terminate because `x1` decreases to 0 or less.
- If `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0` initially, the loop body does nothing but `x1` is still positive, infinite loop (no termination).

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Post-condition given:**  
`//@ assert x3 >= 0;`

We want to prove that at the end of the loop, `x3` is non-negative.

---

**Can the post-condition serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- **No**, directly. Because within the loop, `x3` is decremented and can be positive or zero, but it is never allowed to drop below 0 if the loop decreases it carefully.
  
- Also, the loop could run zero or more times, so during iteration `x3` may be positive, but the loop invariant must hold *before and after* every iteration, not only at the end.

---

**Can `x3 >= 0` be modified or combined with other conditions to form a valid invariant?**

- Since `x3` starts at some integer value and is decremented conditionally (only if `x3 > 0`), it can never go below zero — decrements only happen when `x3 > 0`.
- Similarly, this logic applies to `x2` and `x1`.

Thus, a suitable invariant could be:

```
x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0
```

Because:

- Before loop starts, `x1 = 1`, `x2` and `x3` are arbitrary positive integers (or at least non-negative).
- Each decrement only happens if the variable is positive.
- Variables are decreased by 1 at each iteration but never below zero.
- This condition will be maintained at every iteration.

This invariant can help imply the post-condition `x3 >= 0` upon loop termination.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**  

> At the start of every iteration (and at the end), the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are always non-negative integers:  
>  
> `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`  
>
> Furthermore, the variables are only decremented when all three are strictly positive.

This invariant captures the safety of the variables not going negative despite the repeated decrements.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the loop begins, `x1=1` (initialized), which is non-negative.
- `x2` and `x3` are initially passed as parameters (could be any integer, but the loop only operates correctly if they start as non-negative or positive). The original code or specification should ensure that `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0` initially, or else the loop may not behave as intended.

- Given `x1`, `x2`, `x3` are all non-negative before entering the loop, the invariant holds for the initial state.

---

### f. Preservation

- Suppose at the start of an iteration, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are all >= 0.
- The code decrements each by 1 **only if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`**.
- Since `x1 > 0` is the loop condition, and the variables decrement only if `x2` and `x3` are positive:
  
  - After decrement, none of `x1`, `x2`, or `x3` can become negative:
    - If each was at least 1 before decrement, after decrement it will be >= 0.
  
- If the condition for decrementing isn't satisfied (either `x2` or `x3` is zero), no change happens, preserving non-negativity.
  
Thus, the invariant is preserved through each iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates when the condition `x1 > 0` is false, i.e., `x1 <= 0`.
- From the invariant, at loop exit:

  ```
  x1 <= 0  (loop termination)
  x2 >= 0
  x3 >= 0
  ```

- `x3 >= 0` is exactly our post-condition.
- The invariant holds up to and including loop exit.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Is the post-condition `x3 >= 0` correct?**  
  Yes, provided `x3` starts non-negative, and decrements occur only when `x3 > 0`.

- **How invariant + loop termination imply post-condition:**

  The invariant ensures `x3 >= 0` during all iterations. When the loop terminates (`x1 <= 0`), `x3` remains non-negative due to the preservation condition.

- Therefore, the assertion `x3 >= 0` holds true when the loop exits.

---

# **Summary of the Loop Invariant and Verification**

---

**Loop Invariant:**

```c
/*@ 
  invariant x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0;
@*/
```

---

**Explanation:**

- The invariant correctly characterizes the variables that control the loop.
- It holds initially, is preserved by the loop body, and suffices to prove post-condition upon termination.
- This invariant is strong enough to understand the loop behavior and guarantees that no variable becomes negative during execution.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.

2025-12-22 23:05:49,136 - DEBUG  - invgen reasoning
2025-12-22 23:05:49,136 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this problem, I need to find a loop invariant that:
1. Holds before the loop starts (Establishment)
2. Is preserved by each iteration (Preservation)
3. Together with loop termination, proves the post-condition `x3 >= 0`

Let me analyze the loop behavior:

**Pre-condition analysis:**
- `x1 = 1`, `d1 = d2 = d3 = 1`
- `x2` and `x3` are the input parameters (unchanged initially)

**Loop behavior:**
- Continues while `x1 > 0`
- Decrements `x1`, `x2`, `x3` by 1 only if both `x2 > 0` AND `x3 > 0`
- If either `x2 ≤ 0` or `x3 ≤ 0`, no variables change

**Key insight:**
The decrements only happen when `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`. This means:
- `x2` can never become negative (decremented only when > 0)
- `x3` can never become negative (decremented only when > 0)
- If `x2 ≤ 0` or `x3 ≤ 0` initially or at any point, the loop becomes infinite (no change to `x1`)

**Critical observation:**
For the loop to terminate, we need `x1` to eventually become ≤ 0. Since `x1` starts at 1 and decrements by 1 only when both `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, we need at least one successful decrement. This requires that initially `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.

**Loop invariant:**
The invariant should capture that `x3 ≥ 0` throughout. Since decrements only occur when `x3 > 0`, after decrement `x3` becomes `x3 - 1` which is still ≥ 0. Similarly for `x2`.

```c
void foo131(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop repeatedly decreases the values of variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by constants `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively, but only if `x1 > 0`, `x2 > 0`, and `x3 > 0` simultaneously. The intended outcome appears to reduce these values until `x1` (the loop controlling variable) is no longer positive, thus terminating the loop.

At the end, there is an assertion that `x3 >= 0`. So a key functional goal is ensuring the loop never drives `x3` below zero.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Loop condition:** `while(x1 > 0)`
  - The loop continues as long as `x1` remains positive.
- **Loop Body:**
  - It checks if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.
  - Only if both `x2` and `x3` are positive does it decrement `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`.
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `x1` controls loop iterations.
  - `x2`, `x3` get conditionally decremented.
  - `d1`, `d2`, `d3` are constant increments (all initialized as 1).
- **Initial values:**
  - `x1 = 1`, `d1 = d2 = d3 = 1`
  - `x2`, `x3` are input parameters, unknown.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Assuming some initial example values for `x2` and `x3` to understand behavior. Let’s consider:

- `x2 = 3`; `x3 = 3`
- We track `(x1, x2, x3)` at 
  - pre-loop (before 1st iteration)
  - post-iteration (after 1st, 2nd, ..., 5th iteration)

| Step               | x1 | x2 | x3 | Explanation                              |
|--------------------|----|----|----|------------------------------------------|
| Pre-loop           | 1  | 3  | 3  | Initial values                           |
| After 1st iteration | 0  | 2  | 2  | Decremented all by 1 (conditions met)  |
| After 2nd iteration | 0  | 2  | 2  | Loop terminates since x1=0 (no second) |
| After 3rd iteration | N/A| N/A| N/A| --Loop has terminated--                  |
| After 4th iteration | N/A| N/A| N/A| --Loop has terminated--                  |
| After 5th iteration | N/A| N/A| N/A| --Loop has terminated--                  |

Because `x1` starts at 1, the loop can only run once if the condition `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` holds. 

If, for example, `x2` or `x3` started at 0 or less, the body’s decrement block would never execute:

- Suppose `x2 = 0`, `x3 = 5`

| Step               | x1 | x2 | x3 | Explanation                              |
|--------------------|----|----|----|------------------------------------------|
| Pre-loop           | 1  | 0  | 5  |                                         |
| After 1st iteration | 1  | 0  | 5  | No decrement since `x2 > 0` false; `x1` unchanged |
| After 2nd iteration | 1  | 0  | 5  | Loop infinite because `x1` never decremented |

This shows a potential infinite loop if `x2` or `x3` are ≤ 0 initially.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert x3 >= 0; */
```

We want to prove that upon loop termination, `x3` is never negative.

**Can the post-condition serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- **No.** The condition `x3 >= 0` is true at termination, but during the loop, it may temporarily be greater or equal to zero.
- The invariant must hold **before and after** each iteration, not only after loop termination.
- The invariant needs to involve relations that hold continuously, not just at termination.

**Modifying the post-condition to form an invariant:**

- Since the loop decrements `x3` by `d3` only if `x3 > 0`, it suggests `x3` never falls below zero **while inside the loop**.
- We can propose an invariant:  
  "`x3 >= 0` always holds during loop execution"  
  or, more generally,  
  "`x3` is always non-negative throughout."

Additionally, since `x1` controls the loop, and the decrements happen together, the remaining values of `x2` and `x3` relate to their initial values and `x1`. Tracking these relations could help a stronger invariant, but minimal one is `x3 >= 0`.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

- `x1 >= 0`
- `x2 >= 0`
- `x3 >= 0`
- Additionally, the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` have been decremented by the same number of iterations matched to how many times the decrement happened (could be reflected as: initial values minus the decrements accumulated).

More formally, something like:

- `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`

**Why is this valid?**

- Loop only decrements when `x1 > 0`, `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.
- Decrementing by 1 when all are positive keeps all variables ≥ 0.
- If any of `x2` or `x3` becomes zero or less, decrement block is skipped, so no negatives introduced.
- Thus, none will ever drop below zero.

---

### e. Establishment

- Initially, `d1 = d2 = d3 = 1`, `x1 = 1` (given).
- The inputs `x2` and `x3` are parameters to the function and not guaranteed ≥ 0 necessarily.
- For the loop invariant to hold at start, if inputs `x2` or `x3` were negative, the invariant would be violated.
- So **establishment holds only if** the precondition includes:  
  `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`  
  Because if the loop body never executes (because `x2` or `x3` ≤ 0), variables remain unchanged and still non-negative (or violate invariant initially).
- Assuming this pre-condition, `x1`, `x2`, `x3` are all ≥ 0 before start.

---

### f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration: `x1 > 0`, `x2 >= 0`, `x3 >= 0`.
- If loop condition `x1 > 0` is true:
  - The loop body checks if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.
    - If so, decrements all three by 1.
    - Since all > 0, after decrement all become ≥ 0, preserving the invariant.
    - If not (either `x2` or `x3` ≤ 0), no decrement occurs, variables unchanged, invariant preserved.
- Thus the invariant holds after iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `x1 <= 0`.
- At termination, the invariant states `x1 >= 0`, `x2 >= 0`, `x3 >= 0`.
- These combined imply at termination `x1 == 0` (because loop condition ended), and `x2, x3 >= 0`.
- Therefore, the loop invariant holds at termination.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- Post-condition asserts `x3 >= 0`.
- From invariant and termination condition (`x1 <= 0`), it follows `x3 >= 0`.
- Hence, the post-condition is **correct**.

---

## Summary of Invariant and Verification

**Loop Invariant (formal annotation style):**

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0;
@*/
```

**Why this invariant works:**

- **Establishment:** Requires `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` before loop.
- **Preservation:** Decrement happens only if `x2 > 0 && x3 > 0 && x1 > 0`, ensuring values never go negative.
- **Termination:** On exit when `x1 <= 0`, the invariant ensures `x3 >= 0`, proving the assertion.

- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo131(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop repeatedly decrements the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by constant amounts (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`, all initialized to 1) under certain conditions, specifically as long as `x1 > 0` holds true and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The apparent goal is to reduce these variables gradually while maintaining certain properties, and ultimately ensure that after the loop ends, `x3` is guaranteed to be non-negative (`x3 >= 0`).

**Loop Structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while(x1 > 0)` — the loop is executed while `x1` remains greater than zero.
- **Conditional decrements inside:**
  - If `x2 > 0`
    - And if `x3 > 0`
      - Then `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are each reduced by their respective decrements (`d1`, `d2`, `d3`), all equal to 1.
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `x1` — controls loop execution.
  - `x2`, `x3` — conditionally decremented inside the loop.
  - `d1`, `d2`, `d3` — decrement values, all initialized to 1, constant during the loop.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's define the **initial state** (prior to loop start) and trace how variables change during iterations.

---

**Pre-Loop Sampling (Iteration 0):**

- `x1 = 1`
- `x2 = initial parameter` (unknown; ≥ 0 or possibly negative)
- `x3 = initial parameter` (unknown; ≥ 0 or possibly negative)
- `d1 = d2 = d3 = 1`

---

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**

Because `x1` starts at 1, loop runs if `x1 > 0`. Let's consider a scenario assuming `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` initially (otherwise, no decrements happen).

| Iteration | x1 before | x2 before | x3 before | Loop body executed? | x1 after  | x2 after | x3 after |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 (start) | 1         | x2_init   | x3_init   | Yes (assumed)       | 0         | x2_init-1 | x3_init-1 |
| 2         | 0         |           |           | No (x1>0 fails)     |           |           |           |

At iteration 1:

- Since `x1 = 1 > 0`, the loop runs.
- If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, all vars decrement by 1.
- `x1` becomes `0` after iteration 1.

At iteration 2, since `x1 = 0`, loop terminates immediately.

---

*If initially `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`, then the condition inside loop does not decrement anything, and we get:*

| Iteration | x1 before | x2 before | x3 before | Loop body executed? | x1 after  | x2 after | x3 after |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 (start) | 1         | ≤ 0 or ≤ 0| ≤ 0 or ≤ 0| No                  | 1         | same      | same      |
| 2         | 1         |           |           | Loop continues forever (infinite loop) |

Because loop condition (`x1 > 0`) stays true but no decrement happens inside loop — **possible infinite loop** in this case.


---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert x3 >= 0; */
```

Indicates that on exiting the loop, the variable `x3` should be non-negative.

---

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- **No** — `x3 >= 0` may **not** hold during iterations (for example, `x3` might become negative if it is decremented below zero).
- It is a post-condition intended to hold *after* the loop terminates, not necessarily during execution.

---

**Can it be modified to create a valid invariant?**

Yes. To ensure `x3` remains non-negative at all times during the loop execution, we can strengthen the invariant to:

- `x3 >= 0` holds **at every point before and after each iteration**.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (in natural language):**

1. `x1 >= 0` — Loop variable controlling execution never goes negative.
2. `x2 >= 0` — `x2` never becomes negative.
3. `x3 >= 0` — `x3` never becomes negative.
4. Additionally, all decrements occur only if both `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.

Formally:

```
x1 >= 0 ∧ x2 >= 0 ∧ x3 >= 0
```

---

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- At start, all variables initialized to values ≥ 1 or greater.
- Decrements happen only if variables are positive, preventing them from becoming negative.
- The condition checking `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` **guards against decrements when these variables are zero or less**, so variables stay non-negative.
- `x1` is decremented under the same guarded condition; it will hit 0 but not below, hence `x1 >= 0`.
  
Thus, this invariant holds:

- Initially (before first iteration).
- Preserved across iterations by the guarded decrements.
- At loop exit (when `x1 <= 0`), it ensures variables are still non-negative.

---

### e. Establishment

- Initial values: `x1 = 1`, `d1 = d2 = d3 = 1` (constants, positive).
- Input parameters `x2`, `x3` declared as integers but assumed in typical use cases here to be ≥ 0 or positive (otherwise loop may never terminate).
- Before the loop begins, since decrements haven’t happened, `x1 = 1 ≥ 0`, `x2` and `x3` as input parameters are assumed initially ≥ 0.
- Therefore, the proposed invariant `(x1 ≥ 0 ∧ x2 ≥ 0 ∧ x3 ≥ 0)` holds before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

- Assume loop invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `x1, x2, x3 ≥ 0`.
- The loop body decrements these variables by 1 **only if** `x2 > 0 && x3 > 0`.
- Since to decrement `x2` and `x3`, they must both be strictly greater than zero, subtracting 1 preserves `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0` because they go from positive to zero or positive.
- Because decrements happen simultaneously, `x1` also decreases by 1 but given `x1 > 0` per loop condition, after decrement `x1 ≥ 0`.
- If conditions fail (either `x2 ≤ 0` or `x3 ≤ 0`), no decrement happens, variables remain unchanged and non-negative.
  
Therefore, invariant is preserved after each iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `x1 ≤ 0`.
- Because `x1` is decremented only if conditions pass, and the decrement is guarded to keep `x1 ≥ 0`, loop exits when `x1 == 0`.
- At exit:
  - `x1 == 0` (loop condition false).
  - By invariant, `x2 ≥ 0` and `x3 ≥ 0`.
  
Thus, the loop invariant still holds true at termination.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**

```c
/*@ assert x3 >= 0;*/
```

**Is it correct?**

- Yes, it is correct based on the invariant and termination condition.
- The invariant guarantees `x3 ≥ 0` throughout execution.
- At loop exit, `x1 ≤ 0`, so loop has stopped, and by the invariant, `x3` remains non-negative.
- Hence, the assert is guaranteed to hold.

---

### Summary of the Loop Invariant and Formal Comments to Fill

```c
/*@
  loop invariant x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0;
  loop assigns x1, x2, x3;
  loop variant x1;
@*/
while (x1 > 0) {
    if (x2 > 0) {
        if (x3 > 0) {
            x1 = x1 - d1;
            x2 = x2 - d2;
            x3 = x3 - d3;
        }
    }
}
```

---

**Explanation:**

- `loop invariant x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0;` is maintained throughout.
- `loop assigns x1, x2, x3;` explicitly marks variables modified.
- `loop variant x1;` demonstrates termination since `x1` decreases by at least 1 each time body executes and is bounded below by 0.

2025-12-22 23:35:56,610 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

2025-12-22 23:36:28,887 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this problem, I need to analyze the loop to determine appropriate invariants that will help prove the post-condition `x3 >= 0`.

Let me trace through the loop behavior:

**Initial state:** `x1 = 1`, `x2 = \at(x2,Pre)`, `x3 = \at(x3,Pre)`, `d1 = d2 = d3 = 1`

**Loop behavior:** 
- The loop continues while `x1 > 0`
- Variables are decremented only when BOTH `x2 > 0` AND `x3 > 0`
- When decremented, all three variables decrease by 1 simultaneously

**Key insight:** The variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented together (or not at all). This means they maintain a fixed relationship throughout the loop.

Let me determine the relationship:
- Initially: `x1 = 1`, `x2 = \at(x2,Pre)`, `x3 = \at(x3,Pre)`
- After k decrements: `x1 = 1 - k`, `x2 = \at(x2,Pre) - k`, `x3 = \at(x3,Pre) - k`
- The amount decreased from initial value is the same for all three variables

Therefore: `\at(x2,Pre) - x2 = \at(x1,Pre) - x1 = 1 - x1`

Similarly: `\at(x3,Pre) - x3 = \at(x1,Pre) - x1 = 1 - x1`

**For the verification goal:** The assertion `x3 >= 0` needs to hold after the loop. However, this may not hold during all iterations (e.g., if `x3` starts negative and stays unchanged, or becomes more negative). So we cannot directly use `x3 >= 0` as an invariant without additional constraints.

But examining the loop termination: the loop exits when `x1 <= 0`. Combined with `x1 >= 0` (since decrements stop when variables would go negative), we have `x1 == 0` at termination. At that point, with the relationship `x3 = \at(x3,Pre) - (1 - x1) = \at(x3,Pre) - 1`, we need `\at(x3,Pre) >= 1` to ensure `x3 >= 0`.

However, looking more carefully: the decrements only happen when `x2 > 0 AND x3 > 0`. This means if either becomes non-positive, no more decrements occur, and `x1` stays fixed. For the loop to terminate with `x1 = 0`, we need exactly one decrement to occur (from initial `x1 = 1`).

```c
void foo131(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

    
        /*@
