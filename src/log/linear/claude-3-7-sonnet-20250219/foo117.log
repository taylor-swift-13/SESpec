}
```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**  
The loop increments two integer counters, `x` and `sn`, simultaneously while some unknown condition (`unknown()`) remains true. The purpose seems to be to count how many times the loop executes through two variables that always change identically. After loop termination, the program asserts that unless `sn` equals -1 (which it never does since it starts at 0 and only increments), `sn` and `x` are equal.

**Intended Outcome:**  
At the end of the loop, the values of `sn` and `x` should be equal if `sn` is not -1 (which should always be the case given initialization and increments).

**Loop Structure:**  
- **Condition:** `while (unknown())` — the loop repeats as long as the `unknown()` function returns true (non-zero). The body does not modify the loop condition explicitly, so termination depends entirely on `unknown()`.
- **Body:**
  - `x = x + 1;` — increment `x` by 1.
  - `sn = sn + 1;` — increment `sn` by 1.
- **Variables:**
  - `x` and `sn` — counters that start at 0 and increment each iteration.
  - `unknown()` — an external, unknown function controlling loop continuation.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s sample `x` and `sn` values at key points:

| Iteration         | `x` (before increment) | `x` (after increment) | `sn` (before increment) | `sn` (after increment) |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Pre-loop (0)      | 0                      |                       | 0                       |                        |
| After 1st iteration| 0                      | 1                     | 0                       | 1                      |
| After 2nd iteration| 1                      | 2                     | 1                       | 2                      |
| After 3rd iteration| 2                      | 3                     | 2                       | 3                      |
| After 4th iteration| 3                      | 4                     | 3                       | 4                      |
| After 5th iteration| 4                      | 5                     | 4                       | 5                      |

- Both `x` and `sn` are incremented by 1 every iteration.
- Their values remain **equal at every point after increments**.
- Since the loop condition depends on `unknown()`, we cannot say if it terminates before or after 5 iterations. But if it terminates, `x` and `sn` will be equal at that moment.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
```c
(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)
```

- This asserts that if `sn` is not -1, then `sn` equals `x`.
- Since `sn` starts at 0 and increments every iteration, `sn` is never -1. So effectively, it asserts:

> **At the end of the loop, `sn == x`.**

**Can this serve as a loop invariant?**

- **NO** — because before the loop begins (`x=0, sn=0`), `sn == x` holds.
- During the iterations, since both increment simultaneously by 1, `sn == x` remains true.
- Hence, `sn == x` **is true at all times**, including pre-loop, each loop iteration, and post-loop.
- So the verification goal *(sn == x)* can serve as a loop invariant itself (without the `sn != -1` guard which is vacuously true).

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**  
> Throughout the execution of the loop, the variables `sn` and `x` hold the same integer value.

**Formal expression:**  
```c
sn == x
```

**Why is this invariant valid?**  
- Initially, both `sn` and `x` start at 0, so the condition holds.
- Each iteration increments both `sn` and `x` by exactly 1, preserving their equality.
- The loop body contains no other operations on these variables.
- Therefore, this condition holds at the beginning and end of every iteration.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established?**  
- At the start (before the loop), `sn = 0` and `x = 0`.
- Therefore, `sn == x` holds before entering the loop.

This satisfies the establishment condition.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved during iterations?**

Assume at the start of an iteration:  
```c
sn == x
```

The loop body increments both by 1:  
```c
x = x + 1;
sn = sn + 1;
```

Then, at the end of the iteration:  
```c
sn' = sn + 1
x' = x + 1
```

Since `sn == x` before the iteration,  
```c
sn' = x + 1 = x'
```

Therefore, the invariant holds after the iteration as well.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**When the loop terminates:**  
- The `unknown()` condition evaluates to false.
- At this point, `sn` and `x` have been incremented an equal number of times.
- Since the invariant `sn == x` held before the last iteration and was preserved during iterations, it must still hold.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Given post-condition:**  
```c
(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)
```

- Since `sn` is initialized at 0 and incremented by 1 each time, `sn` can never be `-1`.
- Hence, the condition `(sn != -1)` is always true.
- By the loop invariant, `sn == x` holds at termination.
- Therefore, the post-condition is logically equivalent to `sn == x` at loop exit, which we have proven.

**Conclusion:**  
- The post-condition is **correct** and follows directly from the loop invariant combined with the termination of the loop.

---

# Summary and Final Proposal

- **Loop invariant:** `sn == x`  
- **Establishment:** Holds before the loop since both are zero.  
- **Preservation:** Both incremented together, so equality is preserved.  
- **Termination:** When the loop exits, the invariant holds and the post-condition follows.  
- **Post-condition validity:** Correct; trivially satisfied given the invariant.

2025-12-23 03:01:54,478 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 0) * (sn == 0) * (v3 == \at(v3,Pre)) * (v2 == \at(v2,Pre)) * (v1 == \at(v1,Pre))`

Loop program: `


void foo117(int v1,int v2,int v3) {

    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;

          loop invariant v3 == \at(v3,Pre);
          loop invariant v2 == \at(v2,Pre);
