### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

  The loop's purpose is to increment the variable `x` starting from 0 until `x` reaches exactly 100,000,000. The way `x` is incremented changes halfway through:
  
  - When `x` is less than 10,000,000, `x` increments by 1.
  - After `x` reaches 10,000,000 (and beyond but less than 100,000,000), `x` increments by 2.
  
  The intended outcome is to exit the loop with `x` exactly equal to 100,000,000, as asserted at the end.

- **Loop Structure:**

  - Loop condition: `while (x < 100000000)`
  - Loop body:
    - Conditional increment:
      - If `x < 10000000`, do `x++` (increment by 1).
      - Else do `x += 2` (increment by 2).
  - Relevant variable: `x` (an unsigned integer, initialized to 0).

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We illustrate samples of `x` before loop and after each of the first five iterations.

| Sampling Point   | Value of `x` | Explanation                       |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **Pre-Loop**     | 0            | Initialized to zero              |
| After iteration 1 | 1            | `x` was 0 (<10M), incremented by 1  |
| After iteration 2 | 2            | `x` was 1 (<10M), incremented by 1  |
| After iteration 3 | 3            | `x` was 2 (<10M), incremented by 1  |
| After iteration 4 | 4            | Same as above                    |
| After iteration 5 | 5            | Same as above                    |

After 10,000,000 iterations, `x` reaches `10,000,000`, then increments by 2 every iteration.

If we consider an iteration where `x` is exactly 10,000,000:

- After iteration (10,000,000): `x` = 10,000,000 (incremented by 1 per iteration)
- Next iteration (`x = 10,000,000`, condition false,  so in loop body):
  Since `x` is not less than 10,000,000 (false), increments by 2:
  After this iteration, `x = 10,000,002`
- Next iterations increment by 2, maintaining evenness and moving towards 100,000,000.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification goal (post-condition):**

  ```c
  assert(x == 100000000);
  ```

  We want to prove `x == 100,000,000` at loop termination.

- **Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

  - **No**, because during the iterations, `x` will not equal 100,000,000 except at termination.
  - The assertion is only true when the loop exits (when `x` reaches 100,000,000).

- **Can we modify the post-condition to form a valid invariant?**

  Yes. We want an invariant that:
  
  - Holds before the loop starts when `x = 0`
  - Remains true after each iteration
  - Implies the target post-condition at termination combined with negated loop condition

- **Observations:**

  - `x` starts at 0 and only increases during the loop.
  - `x` is always less than or equal to 100,000,000 during iterations.
  - When `x < 10,000,000`, increments are by 1 → so x can be any integer from 0 up to 10,000,000.
  - When `x >= 10,000,000`, increments of 2 → so `x` is always even after reaching this threshold.

- **Modified invariant idea:**

  - `0 <= x <= 100000000` (bounds on `x`)
  - If `x < 10,000,000`, no parity restriction (increments by 1)
  - Else `x` is even (because increments by 2 from 10 million onward)

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Natural language invariant:**

  > At the start and end of each loop iteration:
  > - The variable `x` is an unsigned integer satisfying `0 <= x <= 100,000,000`.
  > - If `x` is less than `10,000,000`, then `x` can be any value in that range.
  > - If `x` is greater than or equal to `10,000,000`, then `x` is an even number.

- **Explanation of validity:**

  - Initially, `x = 0` which satisfies `0 <= 0 <= 100,000,000`, and since `0 < 10,000,000`, no parity condition is needed.
  - While `x < 10,000,000`, `x` increments by 1, so it hits every value 0, 1, 2, ..., 9,999,999, 10,000,000.
  - At `x == 10,000,000` the loop switches increments to +2, so next values are 10,000,002, 10,000,004, ..., reaching exactly 100,000,000.
  - Since `x` increases without skipping any values in the first phase and moves through even numbers in the second phase, the invariant is preserved.

---

### e. Establishment

- **How invariant is established initially:**

  - Before the loop: `x` initialized to `0`.
  - `0` satisfies `0 <= x <= 100000000`.
  - Since `0 < 10,000,000`, the parity condition does not apply.
  - Hence, invariant is true before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

- **How invariant is preserved at each iteration:**

  Assume invariant holds at iteration start:

  - `0 <= x <= 100000000`
  - If `x < 10,000,000` no parity restriction
  - If `x >= 10,000,000`, `x` is even.

  **Body:**

  - If `x < 10,000,000`, then `x` increments by 1:
    - New `x` is `x + 1` (still `<= 10,000,000`)
    - No parity condition to maintain here.
  - If `x >= 10,000,000`, `x` increments by 2:
    - Since `x` was even, adding 2 yields another even number.
    - `x` remains in `[10,000,000..100,000,000]` range.
  
  **Check bounds:**

  - Each increment keeps `x` ≤ 100,000,000 since loop breaks as soon as `x >= 100,000,000`.
  - No illegal values.

- Thus invariant holds at end of iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Loop termination condition:**

  The loop exits when `x < 100,000,000` is false, i.e., `x >= 100,000,000`.

- Considering the invariant, at termination:

  - `0 <= x <= 100,000,000`
  - Since loop condition false, `x >= 100,000,000`
  - Hence, `x == 100,000,000` (cannot overshoot because increments are controlled and exact)
  - As increments in second phase progress by 2 starting from an even number and target even end value, the loop hits exact target.

- The invariant is still valid (bounds hold, parity holds if `x >= 10M`).

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Given post-condition:**

  ```c
  assert(x == 100000000);
  ```

- **Is this correct?**

  - **Yes.** Because the invariant ensures `x` marches from 0 to 100,000,000:
    - Prior to 10,000,000 increments by 1 ensure all values can be reached.
    - Past 10,000,000 increments by 2 and parity condition ensure reaching exactly 100,000,000.
  - Loop terminates only when `x >= 100,000,000`.
  - The way increments are defined, `x` cannot overshoot 100,000,000.
  - Therefore, when loop breaks, `x == 100,000,000`.

- **How invariant + termination condition imply post-condition:**

  - Invariant: `0 <= x <= 100000000`, and for `x >= 10000000`, `x` even.
  - Loop exit condition: `!(x < 100000000)` → `x >= 100000000`.
  - Combining:
    - `x >= 100000000` ∧ `x <= 100000000` ⇒ `x == 100000000`.
  - So `assert(x == 100000000)` holds.

---

## **Summary of final proposed loop invariant:**

```c
/*@
  0 <= x <= 100000000 &&
  ((x < 10000000) || (x % 2 == 0))
*/
```

- `x` is always between 0 and 100 million inclusive.
- If `x` is less than 10 million, no parity constraints.
- If `x` is at least 10 million, `x` is an even number.

This invariant explains the loop's behavior fully and satisfies all required conditions for loop invariants.

2025-12-23 03:47:01,703 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `x == 0`

Loop program: `

void foo295() {

    unsigned int x;

    x = 0;
