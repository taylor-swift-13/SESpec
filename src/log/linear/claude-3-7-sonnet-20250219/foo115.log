    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */

```

# a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose**:  
This loop repeatedly increments two integer variables, `x` and `sn`, by 1 each iteration, so that at every iteration, both keep track of the number of times the loop has executed. The condition controlling the loop is an external function call `unknown()`, which returns a non-deterministic boolean value controlling whether the loop continues.

The intended property to verify is a relationship between `sn` and `x` at the end of the loop: it aims to ensure that if `sn` is not equal to -1 (which initially it is 0, so this condition holds), then `sn` and `x` must be equal after the loop ends.

**Structure**:  
- **Loop Condition**: `while (unknown())` — non-deterministically continues or terminates.  
- **Body**:  
  - `x = x + 1;`  
  - `sn = sn + 1;`  
- **Variables**:  
  - `x`: Tracks the count of iterations by incrementing each time.  
  - `sn`: Similarly, increments by 1 each iteration, acting like a counter synchronized with `x`.  
- Both `x` and `sn` are initialized to 0 before the loop.

---

# b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Sample Point               | `sn` | `x`  | Notes                             |
|---------------------------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| **Pre-Loop (initial)**     | 0     | 0     | Both initialized to zero         |
| **After Iteration 1**      | 1     | 1     | Both incremented once            |
| **After Iteration 2**      | 2     | 2     | Both incremented twice           |
| **After Iteration 3**      | 3     | 3     | Same                            |
| **After Iteration 4**      | 4     | 4     | Same                            |
| **After Iteration 5**      | 5     | 5     | Same                            |

> Because the loop increments both `sn` and `x` similarly in each iteration, at all points during execution their values match. The exact iteration count depends on when `unknown()` returns false.

**Post-Loop Sampling**: When the loop terminates (first time `unknown()` returns false), suppose the loop ran \(n\) times, then:

- `sn == n`  
- `x == n`  

---

# c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition)**:  
```c
/*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
```

In words: if `sn` is not -1 (which is always true initially since `sn=0`), then `sn` equals `x` after the loop finishes.

---

**Can this post-condition directly serve as a loop invariant?**

- **No**, because the implication `(sn != -1)` is trivially true throughout, but the equality `(sn == x)` is true at all stages due to parallel increments.
- However, the **post-condition is in fact an invariant condition**: `sn == x` holds true at the start (0 == 0), and remains true after every iteration since both increase by 1 together.
- The condition `(sn != -1)` is essentially always true because `sn` starts at 0 and only increments.

So the post-condition can be simplified and re-expressed as a **basic invariant**:

> `sn == x`

---

**Modification for Invariant Form**:

- Proposed invariant:  
  ```c
  sn == x
  ```
- This invariant holds:  
  - **Establishment**: Before the loop, both are zero, so `sn == x`.  
  - **Preservation**: Each iteration increments both by 1, so equality is maintained.  
  - **Termination**: Upon loop exiting, the invariant holds and `(sn != -1)` holds, so the post-condition is implied.

---

# d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language):**  
"At the start and end of every iteration of the loop, the values of `sn` and `x` are always equal."

**Why is this invariant valid?**  
- Initially, `sn` and `x` are both 0, so the invariant holds.  
- Each loop iteration increments both variables exactly once, preserving their equality.  
- Because the loop body has no other modifications to these variables or control flow that could break this condition, the relationship remains true throughout.  
- Therefore, the invariant holds on entry to and exit from every iteration.

---

# e. Establishment

- Before the loop begins, `sn = 0` and `x = 0`.  
- Since `0 == 0`, the invariant `sn == x` holds at that moment.  
- This satisfies the **Establishment** condition for the invariant.

---

# f. Preservation

- Assume the invariant `sn == x` holds at the beginning of the iteration.  
- The loop condition `unknown()` evaluates to true, so the loop body executes:  
  - `x = x + 1`  
  - `sn = sn + 1`  
- After this iteration:  
  - New `x` value = Old `x` + 1  
  - New `sn` value = Old `sn` + 1  
- Since the old values were equal, the new values remain equal:  
  ``` 
  sn_new = sn_old + 1 
  x_new = x_old + 1 
  => sn_new == x_new
  ```
- Thus, the invariant is **preserved**.

---

# g. Termination Analysis

- When the loop terminates, `unknown()` returns false.  
- At this point, the invariant `sn == x` still holds because increments happen only inside the loop prior to termination.  
- The variables hold some final values:  
  ```
  sn = n
  x = n
  ```
  where `n` is the number of iterations executed.  
- The termination condition `unknown() == false` combined with the invariant implies:  
  ```
  (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)
  ```
- Since `sn` increments from 0 upwards, it cannot be -1; therefore, the post-condition holds true.

---

# h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition is:  
  ```c
  (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);
  ```
- This is **correct** because:  
  - `sn` started at 0 and increments only by 1 each iteration. It cannot become -1.  
  - The invariant `sn == x` is true throughout.  
  - Therefore, when the loop exits, the implication holds trivially (the premise `sn != -1` is true, so the conclusion follows).
- The invariant, combined with loop termination (`!unknown()`), implies the post-condition holds absolutely.

---

# **Summary of Formal Loop Invariant Verification**

| Aspect           | Statement                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Invariant**    | `sn == x`                                                                                   |
| **Establishment**| Holds before loop: both initialized at 0, so equal                                          |
| **Preservation** | Increment both `sn` and `x` by 1 each iteration, maintaining equality                        |
| **Termination**  | On loop exit, the invariant still holds; combined with loop exit condition, implies post-condition |
| **Post-condition**| `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)` is true because `sn` is never -1 and equals `x`                  |

---

If the loop invariant is formally specified using ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations, it might look like this:

```c
/*@
  loop invariant sn == x;
  loop assigns sn, x;
  loop variant <some expression decreasing on loop termination>;
*/
while (unknown()) {
    x = x + 1;
    sn = sn + 1;
}
```

In this snippet, the variant is not explicitly given because `unknown()` is unspecified, but in practice, a well-founded variant would be necessary to prove termination.

- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 0) * (sn == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo115() {

    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_sn ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (unknown()) {
  
      x  = (x + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
       /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);*/
      
    
  
  }`

2025-12-23 00:22:08,498 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this C program, I need to identify the loop invariant that will help verify the post-condition `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)`.

From the analysis:
- Both `sn` and `x` start at 0
- Both are incremented by 1 in each iteration
- They maintain equality throughout all iterations
- The post-condition requires proving that if `sn != -1`, then `sn == x`

The key invariant is that `sn` and `x` are always equal throughout the loop execution.

```c
int unknown();

void foo115() {

    int sn = 0;
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant sn == x;

            while (unknown()) {
  
      x  = (x + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
