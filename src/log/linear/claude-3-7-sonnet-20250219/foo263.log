---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

### Purpose and Intended Outcome

The loop aims to count how many even integers exist from `i = 0` up to (but not including) `i = 2 * k`. The variable `n` is incremented by 1 each time `i` is even during the iteration. Since the loop iterates through all integers from 0 to `2*k - 1`, and increments `n` only when `i` is even, the intended outcome is that `n` equals `k` when the loop finishes. This is because among the `2 * k` integers, exactly half are even numbers (0, 2, 4,..., 2k-2), totaling `k` even numbers.

### Loop Structure

- **Loop Condition:** `while (i < 2 * k)`
  
  The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * k`.

- **Variables:**
  - `k` (input parameter, with precondition `k >= 0` and `k <= 20000001`)
  - `i` (loop counter, initially 0)
  - `n` (counter, initially 0, counts number of even `i` values encountered)

- **Loop Body:**
  - Checks if `i % 2 == 0` (if `i` is even)
  - If yes, increments `n` by 1
  - Then increments `i` by 1 (to move to next integer)

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We track `(i, n)` before the loop, and after each of the first 5 iterations:

- **Pre-Loop:**
  - `i = 0`
  - `n = 0`

- **After 1st iteration (i from 0 to 1):**
  - `i = 1`
  - `n = 1` 
    - Since `0` was even, `n` increments from 0 to 1.

- **After 2nd iteration (i from 1 to 2):**
  - `i = 2`
  - `n = 1` 
    - Since `1` is odd, `n` stays 1.

- **After 3rd iteration (i from 2 to 3):**
  - `i = 3`
  - `n = 2`
    - `2` is even, so `n` increments to 2.

- **After 4th iteration (i from 3 to 4):**
  - `i = 4`
  - `n = 2`
    - `3` is odd, `n` remains 2.

- **After 5th iteration (i from 4 to 5):**
  - `i = 5`
  - `n = 3`
    - `4` is even, `n` increments to 3.

The pattern establishes that after iteration `i`, `n` is counting how many even numbers have been encountered so far.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

  After the loop, the assertion states:

  ```c
  /*@ assert n == k; */
  ```

  Meaning: the variable `n` equals `k` when the loop finishes.

- **Can the goal serve as an invariant?**

  No, the post-condition `n == k` is only true after the loop completely finishes; it cannot hold during the loop because `n` is incrementally increasing.

- **Modifying for a valid invariant:**

  We want an invariant relating `n` and `i` during loop execution.

  Since the loop counts the number of even values of `i` from `0` up to the current `i - 1` inclusive, the number of even integers less than `i` is:

  \[
  \text{count of even numbers} = \left\lceil \frac{i}{2} \right\rceil
  \]

  Actually, since we start from zero, the exact number of even numbers less than `i` (assuming integers starting at 0) is:

  \[
  n = \frac{i + 1}{2} \quad \text{rounded down}
  \]

  Or more formally, for integer division:

  \[
  n = \lfloor \frac{i + 1}{2} \rfloor
  \]

  Checking this with the sample values:

  | i | # even ints < i  | n (sample) |
  |---|------------------|------------|
  | 0 | 0                | 0          |
  | 1 | 1 (0)            | 1          |
  | 2 | 1 (0)            | 1          |
  | 3 | 2 (0,2)          | 2          |
  | 4 | 2 (0,2)          | 2          |
  | 5 | 3 (0,2,4)        | 3          |

  This matches.

- **Proposed Invariant (in algebraic form):**

  \[
  n = \frac{i + 1}{2} \text{ (integer division)}
  \]

  or equivalently,

  \[
  n = \# \{ x \mid 0 \leq x < i, \quad x \text{ even} \}
  \]

- **This invariant:**

  - **Establishment:** Initially `i=0`, `n=0`, and the count of even numbers less than 0 is 0 — invariant holds.
  
  - **Preservation:** Each iteration correctly updates `n` if `i` is even.
  
  - **Termination:** When `i == 2 * k`, number of even numbers less than `2*k` is `k`, so `n = k` (which is the post-condition).

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed loop invariant in natural language:

“At the start of each iteration of the loop (and thus at the end of the previous iteration), the variable `n` equals the count of even numbers between 0 (inclusive) and `i` (exclusive).”

### Explanation why valid:

- Before the first iteration, `n = 0`, `i = 0`, which matches counting even numbers less than `i`.

- Each iteration adds 1 to `i`. If the current `i` is even, then `n` increases by 1, preserving this invariant.

- The invariant precisely captures the progress of counting even numbers as `i` increments.

---

## e. Establishment

- **Initial condition:** Before the loop starts, `i = 0` and `n = 0`.
  
- The set of even numbers less than 0 is empty, so:

  \[
  n = 0 = \#\{x \mid 0 \leq x < 0, x \text{ even}\}
  \]

- This shows the invariant defined above holds before the loop starts.

- The precondition `k >= 0` ensures that the initial condition is well-defined and the loop executes 0 or more times.

---

## f. Preservation

Assuming the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (before the loop body executes):

\[
n = \#\{x \mid 0 \leq x < i, x \text{ even}\}
\]

- The loop body checks if `i % 2 == 0`:

  - If `i` is even, then `n` is incremented by 1.

  - Else, `n` remains the same.

- Then, `i` is incremented by 1.

After these actions:

- New `i` is `i + 1`.

- New `n` is:

  \[
  n' = n + \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } i \text{ is even}\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \]

But since `i` is the value just before increment, and we have incremented `n` in the loop body if `i` was even, after incrementing `i`, we have:

\[
n' = \#\{ x \mid 0 \leq x < i+1, x \text{ even} \}
\]

This shows that the invariant holds after the iteration finishes.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- **When does the loop terminate?**

  When the loop condition `i < 2 * k` becomes false, i.e.,

  \[
  i \geq 2k
  \]

  So, at termination:

  \[
  i = 2k
  \]

- **At termination, the invariant states:**

  \[
  n = \#\{ x \mid 0 \leq x < 2k, x \text{ even} \} = k
  \]

- There are exactly `k` even numbers in the range from 0 to `2k - 1` (inclusive), because numbers 0,2,4,...,2k-2 count to `k` numbers.

- So the invariant remains valid at termination.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition is:

  ```c
  /*@ assert n == k; */
  ```

- From the invariant at termination (`i = 2k`):

  \[
  n = \#\{ x : 0 \leq x < 2k, x \text{ even}\} = k
  \]

- Thus,

  \[
  n == k
  \]

- Therefore, the post-condition is **correct**.

- The invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition (`i >= 2 * k`) logically implies the post-condition.

---

# **Summary**

**Valid Loop Invariant:**  
```
/*@
  invariant 0 <= i <= 2*k &&
  n == (i + 1) / 2 (integer division) OR more precisely:
  n == number of even integers x with 0 <= x < i.
@*/
```

**Why valid:**

- Holds at loop start (`i=0, n=0`).
- Preserved by loop body logic.
- Upon termination (`i=2*k`), implies `n == k`.
- Proves given post-condition is true.

---

- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(k,Pre) >= 0 && \at(k,Pre) <= 20000001 && (i == 0) * (n == 0) * (k == \at(k,Pre))`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires k >= 0 && k <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo263(int k) {

    int n;
    int i;

    n = 0;
    i = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

          loop invariant (!(0 < 2 * \at(k,Pre))) ==> ((i == 0)&&(n == 0)&&(k == \at(k,Pre)));
          loop invariant k == \at(k,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (i < 2 * k) {
       if(i % 2 == 0){
       n = n + 1;
      }
       i = i + 1;
      }

2025-12-22 22:13:34,872 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(k,Pre) >= 0 && \at(k,Pre) <= 20000001 && (i == 0) * (n == 0) * (k == \at(k,Pre))`

Loop program: `

/*@
