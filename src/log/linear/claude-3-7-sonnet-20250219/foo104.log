## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
This loop simply counts `x` from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. It increments `x` by 1 in each iteration until `x` is no longer less than `n`. The intended outcome after the loop exits is that `x` is at least `n`, effectively `x >= n`.

Since `x` starts at 0, and increments by 1 each time, if `n` is positive or zero, the loop will iterate exactly `n` times. If `n` is negative, the condition `x < n` is false at the start (since `x=0` and `0 < n` is false), so the loop never executes.

**Loop Structure:**  
- *Loop Condition:* `x < n`  
- *Loop Body:* Increment `x` by 1 (`x = x + 1;`) each iteration  
- *Relevant Variables:*  
  - `x`: loop counter variable starting at 0 and incremented each iteration  
  - `n`: the loop bound/limit  
- *Input Parameters:*  
  - `n` (int), `v1`, `v2`, `v3` (the latter three are not used in this loop)  

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s do manual iteration sampling of variables. Assume `n` to be some values to illustrate behavior.

| Iteration | x (start) | Loop Condition (x < n)? | x (end) |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|---------|
| 0 (pre)  | 0          | 0 < n                  | —       |
| 1        | 0          | True                   | 1       |
| 2        | 1          | True                   | 2       |
| 3        | 2          | True                   | 3       |
| 4        | 3          | True                   | 4       |
| 5        | 4          | True                   | 5       |

*These samples assume `n >= 5` so loop actually executes 5 times.*

- After iteration 1, `x=1`  
- After iteration 2, `x=2`  
- ... and after iteration 5, `x=5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
- If `n <= 0`, loop never executes, and `x=0` at exit.  
- If `n = 5`, loop terminates when `x=5` (since the condition `x < n` becomes false).

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
`assert (x != n) ==> (n < 0);`

This states: If at the end of the loop `x` is not equal to `n`, then `n` must be negative. Intuitively:

- If `n >= 0`, the loop increments `x` until `x == n`.  
- If `n < 0`, the loop does not run (`x=0`, `x != n` is true), so `x != n` is true and `n < 0` is true.

**Can the verification goal be used as part of the loop invariant?**

- **No.** The goal depends on the final relation of `x` and `n` at loop termination. During intermediate iterations, `x != n` is almost always true until the final iteration, but `n < 0` might or might not be true. For example, if `n = 10`, during iterations `x` is always different from `n` but `n < 0` is false. So this implication does not hold at intermediate steps.

- **Modification to create invariant:**  
We need an invariant expressing a consistent relationship between `x` and `n` that holds before, during, and after loops.

A natural invariant is:

> `0 <= x <= n`, *or*  
> `(x <= n) if n >= 0`, and for negative `n`, `x` is zero.

Since `x` increases from 0 to `n` (or stops if `n` negative), the invariant can express:

```c
0 <= x && (x <= n || n < 0)
```

This states:

- `x` is never negative (correct because `x` starts at 0 and increments by 1), AND  
- Either `x <= n` OR `n` is negative (loop does not execute further).

At loop termination with negation of `x < n` => `x >= n`.

Combining with this invariant, we can derive the postcondition.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**  
"At the start and end of each iteration, the counter `x` satisfies `0 <= x <= n` if `n` is non-negative, and `x == 0` if `n` is negative."

Or more formally:

- Before and after each iteration:
  
  If `n >= 0` then `0 <= x <= n`  
  Otherwise `x == 0` (since loop body does not execute for `n < 0`)

**Why this invariant is valid:**

- `x` starts at 0 (`x = 0`), which respects the invariant for any `n`.  
- The loop increments `x` by 1 each time until `x < n` fails, so `x` increases monotonically.  
- If `n < 0`, the loop condition `x < n` is false at the start (since `0 < n` is false), so `x` stays 0.  
- If `n >= 0`, `x` is incremented until reaching `n`. So `x` never becomes greater than `n`.  
- The invariant preserves `x` within valid bounds throughout the loop.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established before the first iteration?**

- Initially, `x = 0`.  
- If `n >= 0`, then `0 <= x = 0 <= n` trivially holds.  
- If `n < 0`, then `x = 0`, which satisfies `x == 0` trivially.  
- Thus the invariant `0 <= x <= n` (or `x == 0` if `n < 0`) holds true before the first iteration, satisfying *establishment.*

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved through each iteration?**

- Assume the invariant holds at the *start* of the iteration:  

  - If `n >= 0`, `0 <= x <= n` holds.  
  - The loop condition `x < n` is true, so `x` is strictly less than `n`. Thus `x + 1 <= n`.  

- During the loop body, `x` is incremented:  
  `x := x + 1`  

- After increment,  
  - For `n >= 0`, `x` becomes `x + 1` which is at most `n` because `x < n` previously. So `0 <= x <= n` still holds.  
  - For `n < 0`, the loop condition is false, so this iteration does not occur.  

Therefore, the invariant is preserved at the *end* of each iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**State of variables at loop termination:**

- The loop terminates when `x < n` is false, i.e. when `x >= n`.  
- Combining with the invariant, for `n >= 0`, at termination `x == n` exactly (since `x` increments by 1).  
- For `n < 0`, the loop never executes so `x == 0` and `x >= n` means `0 >= n` which holds if `n < 0`.

**Validity of invariant at termination:**

- The invariant expression `0 <= x <= n` or `x == 0` still holds at termination.  
- Termination condition implies `x >= n`. Combined with the invariant bounds, this fixes `x == n` if `n >= 0`.  
- Hence the invariant remains valid at loop exit.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Recall the post-condition:**  
```c
assert (x != n) ==> (n < 0);
```

**Is this assertion correct?**

- If `n >= 0`, the loop runs until `x == n`, so `x != n` is false at termination, so assertion holds trivially.  
- If `n < 0`, the loop does not run, `x == 0` and `x != n` can be true (since `0 != n` where `n < 0`) and `n < 0` is true, so assertion holds.  

Thus the post-condition correctly distinguishes negative `n` values by the failure of `x == n`.

**How does the invariant and loop termination imply this post-condition?**

- We know the invariant guarantees `0 <= x <= n` if `n >= 0`.  
- When loop exits, `x >= n` by negation of condition, so combined with invariant:  
  `x == n` if `n >= 0`. Hence `x != n` is false if `n >= 0`.  
- If `x != n`, then `n < 0` must hold since the only other way is disproved by loop termination and invariant.  

---

# **Summary & Final Proposed Loop Invariant**

```c
/*@
    loop invariant ((n >= 0) ==> (0 <= x && x <= n)) && ((n < 0) ==> (x == 0));
*/
```

**Explanation:**  
- When `n` is non-negative, `x` counts from 0 upwards to `n` but never exceeds it.  
- When `n` is negative, the loop never executes and `x` remains 0.  
This invariant provides a strong basis for proving the post-condition after loop termination.

- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 0) * (v3 == \at(v3,Pre)) * (v2 == \at(v2,Pre)) * (v1 == \at(v1,Pre)) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo104(int n,int v1,int v2,int v3) {
  
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;
          loop invariant (!(0 < \at(n,Pre))) ==> ((x == 0)&&(v3 == \at(v3,Pre))&&(v2 == \at(v2,Pre))&&(v1 == \at(v1,Pre))&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
          loop invariant v3 == \at(v3,Pre);
          loop invariant v2 == \at(v2,Pre);
          loop invariant v1 == \at(v1,Pre);
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (x < n) {
      
      x  = (x + 1);
      
    }
            
    /*@ assert (x != n) ==> (n < 0); */
    
  }`

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 0) * (v3 == \at(v3,Pre)) * (v2 == \at(v2,Pre)) * (v1 == \at(v1,Pre)) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `
