2025-12-23 04:44:15,786 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Below is a comprehensive analysis of the loop and the verification goal in the provided C code snippet:

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop is designed to increment the variable `z` and a counter `c` repeatedly, but only while `c` is less than 36.
- The initial value of `z` is calculated as `36 * y`. Since `y` is constrained (`0 <= y <= 127`), `z` starts within a known range.
- The purpose appears to be incrementing `z` exactly as long as `c < 36`, thus `z` would increase by up to 36 (at most once per iteration) and `c` counts how many increments were made, capping at 36.
- Because the loop control depends on `unknown()`, an unspecified nondeterministic condition, it may iterate zero or more times, but the `if (c < 36)` limits the increment actions.

**Structure and Governing Condition:**

- The loop condition is `while (unknown())`. Since `unknown()` is an opaque function, the loop's execution length is nondeterministic.
- Inside the loop, we have:
  ```c
  if (c < 36) {
    z = z + 1;
    c = c + 1;
  }
  ```
- Variables relevant to the loop behavior:
  - `c` (initialized 0): tracks how many times the increment of `z` happened, capped at 36.
  - `z` (initialized `36 * y`): incremented by 1 each time when `c < 36`.
  - `y` (input parameter): constrained precondition `0 <= y <= 127`.
- The loop can exit at any point, depending on `unknown()`.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's simulate the changes for the first 5 iterations under the assumption that the loop executes at least 5 iterations and that `c < 36` during these iterations (so the increments happen).

- **Pre-loop:**
  - `c = 0`
  - `z = 36 * y` (depends on input)

- **Iteration 1 (after first loop body execution):**
  - Since `c < 36` (0 < 36), 
    - `z = 36 * y + 1`
    - `c = 1`

- **Iteration 2:**
  - `c = 1 < 36`, 
    - `z = 36 * y + 2`
    - `c = 2`

- **Iteration 3:**
  - `c = 2 < 36`, 
    - `z = 36 * y + 3`
    - `c = 3`

- **Iteration 4:**
  - `c = 3 < 36`,
    - `z = 36 * y + 4`
    - `c = 4`

- **Iteration 5:**
  - `c = 4 < 36`,
    - `z = 36 * y + 5`
    - `c = 5`

This pattern continues while `c < 36`. 

If the loop continues running after `c >= 36`, increments stop:

- For example, at `c = 36`:
  - The `if (c < 36)` fails.
  - No increment to `z` or `c`.
  - The loop could continue to run due to `unknown()`, but no modifications to `z` or `c`.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal:**

```c
/*@ assert (c < 36) ==> (z < 4608); */
```

- This states: *If after the loop, `c` is less than 36, then `z` is strictly less than 4608.*

**Is this goal suitable as an invariant?**

- No, it cannot be used directly as an invariant because:
  - The assertion talks about the state *after* loop termination.
  - During intermediate iterations, `c` and `z` vary carefully, and the condition `c < 36` may hold true, but the bound `z < 4608` may or may not hold until certain info on `y` and increments is considered.
- It is a *postcondition* rather than a *loop invariant*.

**Can it be modified to form a valid invariant?**

- Let’s analyze the numerical relation between `z`, `c`, and `y` to see if we can find a loop invariant.

- Since initially `z = 36*y`, and during the loop, increments add 1 to `z` and `c` simultaneously (as long as `c < 36`), we can say:

  At any iteration:  
  \[
  z = 36 \times y + c
  \]

- This equality holds from start and is preserved each iteration.

- Using this equality, and the precondition \(0 \le y \le 127\), we can analyze `z` subject to `c`.

- Consider the values:

  - Max \(y = 127\)  
    Then initial \(z = 36 \times 127 = 4572\).
  
  - Increments increase \(z\) by \(c\).

- When \(c < 36\),  
  \[
  z = 36y + c < 36y + 36
  \]

- The assert states:  
  \[
  (c < 36) \implies (z < 4608)
  \]

- To verify that \(z < 4608\) when \(c < 36\):

  For \(z = 36y + c\):  
  \[
  36y + c < 4608
  \implies 36y + 36 \le 36y + c < 4608
  \]

  The worst case (max \(c\)) before limit is \(36\), so the maximal \(z\) at \(c < 36\) is \(36y + 35\).

- Check if:

  \[
  36y + 35 < 4608
  \]

- For max \(y=127\):

  \[
  36 \times 127 + 35 = 4572 + 35 = 4607 < 4608
  \]

- So indeed, if \(c < 36\), \(z < 4608\).

- This suggests:

  - The invariant \(z = 36y + c\) holds at start and is preserved.
  - Using that, the postcondition can be derived.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

- "At the start and end of every loop iteration, the value of `z` equals `36 * y + c`, where `c` is between 0 and 36 (inclusive)."

**Detailed explanation:**

- Initially, `c=0` and `z=36*y`, so the invariant holds:
  \[
  z = 36*y + 0
  \]
  
- During each iteration where `c < 36`:
  - Both `z` and `c` are incremented by 1, preserving the equation:
  \[
  z_{new} = z_{old} + 1 = 36*y + c_{old} + 1 = 36*y + c_{new}
  \]

- When `c >= 36`, the `if` condition stops increments; therefore, `c` and `z` remain unchanged, still satisfying the equality above.

- The invariant also naturally constrains `c` in `[0,36]`, since increments happen only while `c < 36`.

---

## e. Establishment

- **How the invariant is established before the first iteration:**

  - Initially,
    - `c = 0`
    - `z = 36 * y`
  - So,
    \[
    z = 36*y + 0 = 36*y + c
    \]
  - By the given precondition on `y` (`0 <= y <= 127`), these values are well-defined.
  - Hence, the invariant holds true before the loop starts.

---

## f. Preservation

- **How the invariant is preserved after each iteration:**

  - Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:
    \[
    z = 36 * y + c
    \]
  - If the loop executes, two cases:
    - **Case 1: `c < 36`**
      - According to the loop body:
        ```
        z = z + 1;
        c = c + 1;
        ```
      - After update:
        \[
        z_{new} = z_{old} + 1 = 36*y + c + 1 = 36*y + (c+1)
        \]
      - So invariant holds with `c` incremented by 1.

    - **Case 2: `c >= 36`**
      - The `if` condition fails, no increment on `c` or `z`.
      - Then \(z\) and \(c\) remain the same, invariant trivially still valid.
      - Also remember the increments stop at `c=36`.

- Therefore, preservation condition is satisfied.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- **When does the loop terminate?**

  - Loop exits when `unknown()` returns false.
  - Since `unknown()` is nondeterministic, loop may terminate at any time.
  - Variables at termination:
    - `c` integer in `[0, 36]` (cannot exceed 36 as increments stop at `c=36`).
    - `z = 36*y + c`.

- **Validity of invariant at termination:**

  - Invariant holds as it is maintained throughout the loop.
  - The invariant is thus true at loop exit.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Given post-condition:**

  ```c
  /*@ assert (c < 36) ==> (z < 4608); */
  ```

- **Evaluate correctness:**

  - Using the invariant, when loop terminates:

    \[
    z = 36*y + c
    \]

  - Given that \(y \le 127\) (precondition) and \(c < 36\) in the antecedent, we estimate:

    \[
    z \le 36 \times 127 + 35 = 4572 + 35 = 4607 < 4608
    \]

  - Therefore, the assertion is valid.

- **How invariant and termination imply post-condition:**

  - From the loop invariant:

    \[
    z = 36*y + c
    \]

  - Combining post loop condition \(c < 36\):

    \[
    z = 36*y + c < 36*y + 36
    \]

  - Since \(y \le 127\):

    \[
    z < 36 \times 127 + 36 = 4572 + 36 = 4608
    \]

  - Thus:

    \[
    (c < 36) \implies (z < 4608)
    \]

  - Hence, the assertion holds.

---

# Summarized Response: Loop Invariant and Analysis

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36 && z == 36 * y + c;
*/
while (unknown()) {
  if (c < 36) {
    z = z + 1;
    c = c + 1;
  }
}
```

- This invariant holds initially (establishment), is preserved in each iteration (preservation), and at loop termination it implies the post-condition (termination + correctness).

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.

Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `0 <= \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 127 && (z == 36 * \at(y,Pre)) * (c == 0) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre)) * (x1 == \at(x1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires 0 <= y && y <= 127;
    */
    
void foo74(int y,int x1,int x2,int x3) {
  int c = 0;
  int z = 36 * y;

2025-12-23 04:44:15,812 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop repeatedly increments two variables `z` and `c` as long as the function `unknown()` returns a true-like value and the condition `c < 36` holds.
- Initially, `z` is set to `36 * y`, with `y` constrained between 0 and 127.
- Inside the loop, if `c < 36`, then `z` is incremented by 1 and `c` is incremented by 1.
- The goal seems to be to increment `z` by 1 up to 36 times, but only while the loop condition `unknown()` is true.
- The assertion at the end relates `c < 36` to an upper bound on `z` (namely `z < 4608`).

**Loop Structure:**

- Loop Condition: `while (unknown())` (unknown function - non-deterministic or environment dependent)
- Loop Body:
  - `if (c < 36)`
    - `z = z + 1;`
    - `c = c + 1;`
- Relevant Variables:
  - `y`: input parameter, 0 ≤ y ≤ 127
  - `c`: counter of increments inside loop, initialized to 0
  - `z`: initialized as `36 * y`, incremented when `c < 36`
- Other parameters `x1`, `x2`, `x3` are unused.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Note: Since `unknown()` is non-deterministic, we assume the loop executes at least 5 iterations for sampling.

| Iteration | Before Loop / After Iteration: c | z = 36 * y + increments |
|-----------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Pre-Loop  | c = 0                           | z = 36 * y              |
| Iter 1    | c = 1                           | z = 36 * y + 1          |
| Iter 2    | c = 2                           | z = 36 * y + 2          |
| Iter 3    | c = 3                           | z = 36 * y + 3          |
| Iter 4    | c = 4                           | z = 36 * y + 4          |
| Iter 5    | c = 5                           | z = 36 * y + 5          |

- Each iteration (while `c < 36`) increments `c` and `z` by 1.
- If `c >= 36`, the body no longer increments `z` or `c` even if `unknown()` returns true.
- The maximum increment to `z` through this mechanism is 36.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (post-condition to prove):**

```c
/*@ assert  ( c < 36 ) ==> ( z < 4608 ) ; */
```

- It states: if after the loop, `c` is still less than 36, then `z` is strictly less than 4608.

**Can this be part of the loop invariant?**

- NO. This assertion is about a state at or after loop termination because it talks about `c` and `z` values that must hold when loop ends (asserted after the loop).
- While the loop iterates, `c` and `z` are changing; the specific inequality involving the constant 4608 is not maintained invariantly during all iterations.
- Specifically, `z` increments from `36 * y` up to `36 * y + c`. `z < 4608` depends on `y`, `c`, and their combination.

**Can this be modified to create a valid invariant?**

- Let's express `z` in terms of `y` and `c` (analysis shows `z = 36 * y + c` when `c < 36`).
- The post-condition: `(c < 36) => ( z < 4608 )`.

Given `z = 36 * y + c < 4608`, and `c < 36`, the invariant can be related to the bound on `y`.

- Since `c < 36`, to make `z < 4608`, roughly require: `36 * y + 36 <= 4608` which means `36 * y < 4572`, or `y < 127` (approximately).

- We know from precondition `0 <= y <= 127`.

- So invariant candidates:
  1. `z == 36 * y + c` (exact relation between `z`, `y`, and `c`)
  2. `c <= 36` (loop bounded by 36 increments)
  3. Because `y <= 127`, the maximal value for `z = 36 * 127 + 36 = 4632` which is just above 4608, but the post-condition uses `< 4608`.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

- At the start and end of every iteration:
  - `0 <= c <= 36`
  - `z = 36 * y + c`
  - `0 <= y <= 127` (pre-condition on `y`)
  
This expresses exactly how `z` relates to `y` and the counter `c`, and bounds `c`.

**Why is this valid?**

- `c` starts at 0 and increments by 1 if less than 36, so `c` is always in `[0..36]`.
- Each time `c` is incremented, `z` is incremented as well, so `z - 36*y = c` always holds.
- `y` does not change in the loop.
- This invariant is established before the loop (`c=0`, `z=36*y+0`) and maintained by the increments.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the first iteration:
  - `c = 0`, and `z = 36 * y`.
  - So `z = 36 * y + c` trivially holds.
  - Since `c=0`, `0 <= c <= 36` is true.
  - Precondition states `0 <= y <= 127`.
- Thus, the invariant holds initially (before loop starts).

---

### f. Preservation

Assume the invariant:

```
0 <= c <= 36
z = 36 * y + c
```

holds at the start of an iteration, and the loop condition `unknown()` is true.

Inside the loop:

- If `c < 36`:
  - `c = c + 1`
  - `z = z + 1`
- If `c >= 36`:
  - no changes to `c` or `z`.

Verify that invariant holds at end of iteration:

- Case 1: `c < 36` before iteration
  - New `c` is `c + 1` which remains ≤ 36 because `c < 36`.
  - New `z` is `z + 1`.
  - Previously `z = 36 * y + c`, now `z + 1 = 36 * y + c + 1`.
  - So post-iteration `z = 36 * y + new_c`, invariant holds.

- Case 2: `c >= 36`
  - Variables unchanged.
  - Invariant trivially preserved.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.

At termination:

- The invariant still holds: `0 <= c <= 36` and `z = 36 * y + c`.
- We know `c` did not increase beyond 36.
- Since `y` is fixed, `z` is exactly `36 * y + c`.

This gives a precise relationship between `z` and `c` at termination.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**

```c
(c < 36) ==> (z < 4608)
```

Check correctness:

- `z = 36 * y + c`

Assuming `(c < 36)`, want to prove `36 * y + c < 4608`.

Worst case, `c` can be as high as 35, so:

```
36 * y + 35 < 4608
36 * y < 4573
y < 4573 / 36 ≈ 127.03
```

Given `y <= 127` from the pre-condition, this is true.

Therefore, when `c < 36`, the assertion `z < 4608` holds.

Also, if `c < 36`, the loop did not increment `z` 36 times fully, so the upper bound on `z` is consistent with this value.

**Link to invariant:**

- From invariant: `z = 36 * y + c`
- From negation of loop condition and given `c < 36`, the post-condition holds.

Hence:

- The invariant combined with the condition `(c < 36)` implies the assertion on `z`.

---

### Summary of the Loop Invariant to Fill in Code Comments

```c
/*@
  invariant 0 <= c && c <= 36;
  invariant z == 36 * y + c;
  invariant 0 <= y && y <= 127;
@*/
```

---

### Final Notes

- The invariant precisely captures the relationship between `z`, `c`, and `y`.
- It is easy to prove establishment, preservation, termination validity.
- The post-condition follows from this invariant and given precondition on `y`.

This is a classic example where the loop increments a counter and a corresponding value in lockstep under a bounded condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.

2025-12-23 04:47:56,681 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
