---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The function `foo75` takes parameters `y`, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` (although `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are not used in the snippet).
- It initializes an integer `c` to 0 and `z` to `36 * y`.
- Inside the loop controlled by `unknown()`, the code increments `z` and `c` by 1 as long as `c < 36`.
  
The overall intended effect of the loop body, when executed, is to increase `z` by 1 for each iteration where `c` is less than 36, and simultaneously increment `c` until it reaches 36 (max). The loop body itself is conditional on `c < 36`, so if `c` is already 36 or more, no increments happen during that iteration.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while (unknown())`
  - The `unknown()` function acts as an unpredictable loop condition. This is an abstraction common in static verification to model unknown or nondeterministic loop termination behavior.
- **Loop body operations:**
  - Conditional: `if (c < 36)`
    - Increment `z` by 1.
    - Increment `c` by 1.
  - If `c >= 36`, no changes happen in the iteration.
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `c` — counter, initialized to 0, incremented up to 36.
  - `z` — initial value `36 * y`, it increments by 1 each iteration where `c < 36`.
- **Precondition:** `0 <= y && y <= 127`
  - Ensures `z` starts in the range `0 <= z <= 36*127 = 4572`.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s consider `unknown()` always returns true for the first five iterations to understand behavior:

| Iteration     | Start of Iteration       | Loop Condition          | Inside Loop (if c<36)      | End of Iteration             |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Pre-Loop**  | c=0, z=36*y (e.g., y=1 → z=36) | -                       | -                          | c=0, z=36                   |
| **1**         | c=0, z=36                | unknown() -> true       | c<36: z=37, c=1            | c=1, z=37                   |
| **2**         | c=1, z=37                | unknown() -> true       | c<36: z=38, c=2            | c=2, z=38                   |
| **3**         | c=2, z=38                | unknown() -> true       | c<36: z=39, c=3            | c=3, z=39                   |
| **4**         | c=3, z=39                | unknown() -> true       | c<36: z=40, c=4            | c=4, z=40                   |
| **5**         | c=4, z=40                | unknown() -> true       | c<36: z=41, c=5            | c=5, z=41                   |

If at some iteration `unknown()` returns false, the loop exits with the current variable states.

Observations:

- Each iteration where `c < 36`, `c` and `z` each increment by 1.
- `c` never exceeds 36 due to the conditional.
- `z` always ≥ initial `36 * y`, and increases by 1 per increment of `c`.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert  ( c < 36 ) ==> ( z >= 0 ) ; */
```

In words: *If `c` is less than 36 after the loop terminates, then `z` is at least 0.*

**Can this be part of the loop invariant?**

- This post-condition states a very weak property: if `c < 36`, then `z >= 0`.
- Given that `z` starts at `36 * y` with `y >= 0`, and increments only positively, `z` is always non-negative at all times (including before/during/after the loop).
- Therefore, the post-condition actually holds true throughout the loop execution (not only after termination), so it *can be* part of the loop invariant.

However, since it is trivial (z non-negative is ensured by initialization and positive increments), it does not fully characterize the main "meaningful" state of the loop.

**Is it sufficient as an invariant alone?**

- No, because it does not constrain how `z` and `c` relate to each other.
- The key property is the relation between `z` and `c`: that `z` started at `36 * y` and increments by 1 for each `c` increment up to 36.

**Modification to create a stronger invariant:**

- Since `z` is incremented exactly the same number of times that `c` is incremented (when `c < 36`), the invariant

  ```
  z = 36 * y + c
  ```

  fully captures the relationship and progression.

- This invariant is:

  - Established before the loop: initially `c=0` and `z=36*y`.
  - Preserved: Each time `c` increments by 1, `z` increments by 1.
  - Implies post-condition: at termination, if `c < 36` then `z = 36*y + c >= 0`.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

- *At the beginning and end of every iteration, `z` is equal to `36 * y` plus the current value of `c`, and `c` is between 0 and 36 inclusive.*

Formally,

```c
/*@
  0 <= c <= 36 &&
  z == 36 * y + c
*/
```

**Explanation of validity:**

- `c` starts at 0 and increments only if `c < 36`, so it never exceeds 36.
- `z` starts at `36 * y` and increments each time `c` increments.
- Therefore, the relation `z == 36 * y + c` holds before the loop and remains true after each iteration where updates occur.
- The invariant captures precisely the cumulative effect of the loop on `z` and `c`, making it inductively invariant.

---

### e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established before the first iteration:**

- Before the loop:

  - `c = 0`
  - `z = 36 * y`

- Substituting:

  ```
  0 <= c <= 36   // holds since c=0
  z = 36*y + c = 36*y + 0 = 36*y  // matches initialization
  ```

- The given precondition `0 <= y <= 127` ensures `36 * y >= 0`.

Hence, the invariant holds before any loops execute.

---

### f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved during each iteration:**

- **Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration:**

  ```
  0 <= c <= 36
  z = 36 * y + c
  ```

- **During this iteration:**

  - If `c < 36`:
    - `z` is incremented by 1 → `z_new = z + 1`
    - `c` is incremented by 1 → `c_new = c + 1`
    - Then:

      ```
      z_new = z + 1 = (36 * y + c) + 1 = 36 * y + (c + 1) = 36 * y + c_new
      c_new = c + 1 <= 36  // since c < 36 before increment
      0 <= c_new <= 36
      ```

    So the invariant holds with updated values.

  - If `c >= 36`:
    - No changes to `z` or `c`.
    - The invariant continues to hold trivially.

Therefore, if invariant is true at the beginning and loop condition allows an iteration, it remains true after that iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns `false`.
- Since `unknown()` is nondeterministic, it can terminate at any time.
- When the loop terminates:

  - `c` is between 0 and 36 (it was never incremented beyond 36)
  - `z = 36 * y + c`

The invariant remains valid since the relation holds regardless of termination time.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition is:

  ```
  ( c < 36 ) ==> ( z >= 0 )
  ```

- Given the established invariant `z = 36 * y + c`, and the precondition `0 <= y`:

  - If `(c < 36)` then

  ```
  z = 36*y + c >= 36*0 + 0 = 0,
  ```

  thus `z >= 0` holds.

- Even if `(c >= 36)` the post-condition imposes no requirement.

- Therefore, the post-condition is **correct** and provable using the loop invariant combined with loop termination.

---

## Summary of Formal Analysis

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36 && z == 36 * y + c; 
  loop assigns c, z; 
  loop variant 36 - c;
*/
while (unknown()) {
  if (c < 36) {
    z = z + 1;
    c = c + 1;
  }
}
```

- The invariant is established before the loop by initialization.
- It is preserved on each iteration by the controlled increments.
- At loop termination, the invariant combined with `c < 36` implies `z >= 0`.
- The verification goal (post-condition) is thus proven.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `0 <= \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 127 && (z == 36 * \at(y,Pre)) * (c == 0) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre)) * (x1 == \at(x1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

2025-12-23 02:46:12,112 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `0 <= \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 127 && (z == 36 * \at(y,Pre)) * (c == 0) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre)) * (x1 == \at(x1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@

- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.

2025-12-23 02:46:29,254 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this problem, I need to fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants about `c` and `z`, and specify the loop assigns clause.

From the analysis in the conversation history, I identified that:
1. `c` starts at 0 and increments by 1 when `c < 36`, so `c` is always in range `[0, 36]`
2. `z` starts at `36 * y` and increments by 1 each time `c` increments
3. The relationship is: `z == 36 * y + c`

Following the rules:
- I must use `\at(y,Pre)` instead of just `y` in the invariant since `y` doesn't change
- I need equality constraints as comprehensively as possible
- The loop assigns clause should list variables modified in the loop

```c
/*@
  loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;
  loop invariant z == 36 * \at(y,Pre) + c;
  loop invariant x3 == \at(x3,Pre);
  loop invariant x2 == \at(x2,Pre);
  loop invariant x1 == \at(x1,Pre);
  loop invariant y == \at(y,Pre);
  loop assigns c, z;

# a. Loop Purpose and Structure

### Purpose and Intended Outcome

- The function initializes `z` as `36 * y` (with a given precondition `0 <= y <= 127`), and `c` as 0.
- The loop repeatedly increments `c` and `z` by 1 **only if** `c < 36`.
- The overall intended behavior: if `c` remains less than 36 during the loop, `z` is incremented accordingly.
- The final assertion checks that if `c < 36` after the loop, then `z` remains non-negative.

Since `z` starts as `36 * y` and `y >= 0`, `z` starts non-negative. Each iteration potentially increases both `c` and `z`.

### Loop Structure

- **Loop condition:** `unknown()` — a nondeterministic or external condition; we cannot directly analyze when the loop ends.
- **Loop body:**
  - Checks `if (c < 36)`.
  - If true:
    - increments `z` by 1.
    - increments `c` by 1.
- **Variables:**
  - `c` — loop counter of increments, starts at 0.
  - `z` — value starting at `36 * y`, potentially incremented by 1 for each iteration with `c < 36`.
- Loop continues running as long as `unknown()` returns true; increments only happen while `c < 36`.

---

# b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Iteration | c (before body) | Condition `c<36` | z (before body) | z (after body) | c (after body) |
|:---------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Pre-loop | 0 | true | 36*y ≥ 0 | - | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | true | 36*y | 36*y + 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | true | 36*y + 1 | 36*y + 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | true | 36*y + 2 | 36*y + 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | true | 36*y + 3 | 36*y + 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 4 | true | 36*y + 4 | 36*y + 5 | 5 |

- **Note:** We assume the loop runs long enough for at least 5 iterations.
- On each iteration when `c < 36`, `c` and `z` both increment by 1.
- Since `y >= 0`, `z` starts at least 0 and grows by 1 per iteration while `c < 36`.
- If at any point `c >= 36`, the `if` condition fails, no increments occur.

- The loop could end at any iteration, depending on `unknown()`. 

---

# c. Verification Goal Analysis

### Verification Goal (Post-condition)

```c
/*@ assert  ( c < 36 ) ==> ( z >= 0 ) ; */
```

- The assertion requires: *if* after the loop `c < 36`, *then* `z >= 0`.
  
### Can this be used as a loop invariant?

- NO, **directly** this post-condition cannot serve as an invariant for several reasons:
  - The condition talks about the state *after* the loop terminates.
  - It involves an implication: `(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)`.
  - This condition may hold only after the loop stops, not necessarily during the intermediate iterations before the loop ends.
  - E.g., if `c >= 36`, the assertion says nothing, so it would be vacuously true but not useful as an invariant.

### Can it be modified to a loop invariant?

- Recall `y >= 0`.
- Initially `z = 36 * y >= 0`.
- Each incrementation of `z` raises its value further.
- So, *before* and *during* the loop, **if** `c < 36`, then `z >= 36*y >= 0`.
- So a useful **stronger invariant** could be:

```c
c <= 36 && z >= 36 * y && ( c <= 36 )
```

Or more simply:

```c
0 <= c <= 36 && z >= 36 * y && c <= 36
```

This captures:
- `c` is between 0 and 36 (since it increments by 1 and maxes at 36).
- `z` has a lower bound of `36 * y` (initial value) and grows as `c` increases.
- Since `y >= 0`, `z >= 0` always.

Such an invariant satisfies:

- **Establishment:** Holds before loop.
- **Preservation:** Maintained by increments.
- **Termination:** At loop end, if `c < 36`, `z` still at least `36 * y >= 0` hence `z >= 0` holds.

---

# d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language)

At the start and end of every loop iteration:

- The counter `c` is between 0 and 36 inclusive.
- The value of `z` is at least `36 * y`.
- Therefore, `z` remains non-negative throughout the loop (given `y >= 0`).
- Moreover, `c` accurately counts how many times `z` has been incremented beyond its initial value.

### Why is this valid?

- **Initialization:** `c=0` and `z=36*y` — clearly satisfy the bounds.
- **Updates:** Each loop iteration where `c < 36` increments both `c` and `z` by 1, preserving the relationships.
- Because no decrements occur, and the increments are synchronous, these inequalities remain true.
- The maximum `c` can reach in the loop body is 36, after which no increments happen.

---

# e. Establishment

- Before the loop starts:
  - `c == 0` which is within `[0,36]`.
  - `z == 36*y` which is non-negative since the precondition is `0 <= y`.
- So the invariant `0 <= c <= 36 && z >= 36*y` holds at loop entry.

---

# f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at loop start iteration:
  - `0 <= c < 36`
  - `z >= 36 * y`
- Entering the loop (condition unknown, but if loop body runs):
  - If `c < 36` is true, then:
    - `c` increments by 1, so `c_new = c + 1 <= 36`.
    - `z` increments by 1, so `z_new = z + 1 >= 36*y + 1 >= 36*y`.

- If `c >= 36`, increments do not happen; invariant still holds trivially.
- Thus, the invariant is preserved **after** each loop iteration.

---

# g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.
- Variables when loop ends:
  - `c` is in `[0,36]`.
  - `z >= 36 * y >= 0`.
- The invariant still holds because it was established and preserved.
- Furthermore, the assertion says:

```c
(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)
```

- Given the invariant, this is true because `z >= 36*y >= 0`.
- If `c >= 36`, the implication is vacuously true.

---

# h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition:

```c
(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)
```

- This is **correct** given:
  - From the invariant: `z >= 36 * y >= 0`.
  - Even if the loop terminates early (with `c < 36`), the invariant guarantees `z` is non-negative.
- Hence, the invariant combined with loop termination (`!unknown()`) implies the post-condition.

---

# Summary of the Loop Invariant and Annotations

```c
/*@
  loop invariant 0 <= c && c <= 36 && z >= 36 * y;
  loop assigns c, z;
  loop variant 36 - c; // c increments toward 36, ensuring progress
*/
while (unknown()) {
  if (c < 36) {
    z = z + 1;
    c = c + 1;
  }
}
```

---

# Final Notes

- The invariant efficiently captures the core relations of the counter `c` and value `z`.
- The precondition on `y` ensures the lower bound on `z` holds at the start.
- The structure of the loop ensures increments stop at `c == 36`, making the domain finite.
- The post-condition is thus guaranteed by the invariant and the loop semantics.

If you want, I can help write a formal annotated version of the code with these invariants as comments. Would you like that?

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.

2025-12-23 02:49:09,791 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**

- The loop uses an unknown (non-deterministic) condition `unknown()`, which could return either true or false arbitrarily.
- Inside the loop, if `c < 36`, it increments `z` and `c` by 1 each.
- The initial value of `z` is computed as `36*y`, where `y` is bounded by 0 and 127.
- The code appears to be incrementing `c` and `z` in lockstep up to `c == 36`. Once `c == 36`, the `if (c < 36)` will be false and no increments happen even if the loop continues.
- The loop’s effect is to increment `c` and `z` together, but only up to 36 increments.
- Since `unknown()` is unspecified, it could terminate anytime, including before `c` reaches 36.

**Intended outcome:**

- The final assertion: `(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)` says: If fewer than 36 increments happened by the time the loop terminates, then `z` must be non-negative.
- Since initially `z = 36 * y` and `y >= 0`, `z` starts non-negative.
- Each increment of `c` is paired with incrementing `z` by 1, so `z` increases or remains.
- The loop preserves `z` non-negativity and properly increments `c` up to 36.

**Loop structure and variables:**

- **Loop condition:** `unknown()`
  - Unknown behavior, no relation is given about it, so assumed nondeterministic.
- **Variables:**
  - `c`: counts how many times `z` has been incremented; initialized to 0.
  - `z`: initialized to `36 * y`, then incremented by 1 only when `c < 36`.
  - `y`: input parameter, constrained to `0 <= y <= 127`.
- **Loop body:**
  - `if (c < 36) { z = z +1; c = c +1; }`
  - Hence increments `c` and `z` by exactly 1 when `c < 36`.
- Variables outside loop remain unchanged.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Since `unknown()` is non-deterministic, the loop may terminate anytime. But the loop body increments `c` and `z` only if `c < 36`.

### Pre-loop (iteration 0 start)

- `c = 0`
- `z = 36 * y`, where `0 <= y <=127` so `z >= 0`

### Iteration samples after each executed iteration (assuming loop executes that iteration):

| Iteration | c before iter | z before iter | Loop body executed? | c after iter | z after iter |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1         | 0             | 36*y          | Yes (c<36)          | 1            | 36*y + 1     |
| 2         | 1             | 36*y + 1     | Yes                 | 2            | 36*y + 2     |
| 3         | 2             | 36*y + 2     | Yes                 | 3            | 36*y + 3     |
| 4         | 3             | 36*y + 3     | Yes                 | 4            | 36*y + 4     |
| 5         | 4             | 36*y + 4     | Yes                 | 5            | 36*y + 5     |

- Each iteration increments both `c` and `z` by 1, as long as `c < 36`.
- If loop continues without terminating, `c` increases by 1 each iteration, up to 36.
- If loop terminates prematurely (unknown() returns false), `c` is less than or equal to current value.

### Post-loop (if loop terminates):

- Loop terminates when either `unknown()` returns false or after some iterations.
- At termination:
  - `c` is some integer between 0 and 36 (inclusive).
  - `z = 36 * y + c` (since each increment corresponds exactly to `c` increments starting from initial `z = 36 * y`).
- Since `y >= 0`, `36 * y >= 0`.
- Because `c` increments are positive additions, `z >= 36 * y >= 0`.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Post-condition:**

```c
/*@ assert  ( c < 36 ) ==> ( z >= 0 ) ; */
```

- If fewer than 36 increments happened (`c < 36`), then `z` must be non-negative.

**Can post-condition serve as loop invariant?**

- No.

**Why?**

- The assertion `(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)` concerns the relationship between `c` and `z` at loop termination.
- During the loop, `c` and `z` both increase, but `z >= 0` could fail only if initial `z` was negative or decremented, which it isn't.
- However, `(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)` is actually trivially true at any point, because `z` starts as `36 * y >= 0` and increments never decrease it.
- But this assertion is conditional on `c < 36`.
- The loop invariant must hold at the start and end of every iteration, including when `c == 36` (since it could happen mid-loop or loop could still run).
- The post-condition doesn’t mention `c == 36` explicitly, so it’s not strong enough for preservation throughout the loop.

**Can we modify the verification goal to an invariant?**

- Yes.
- Since `z` starts at `36 * y` and every increment of `c` increments `z` by 1, we can propose an invariant:

  ```
  0 <= c <= 36 &&
  z = 36 * y + c
  ```

- This fully characterizes the relationship between `z` and `c`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):

- **"During every iteration of the loop, the variable `c` is always between 0 and 36 inclusive, and the variable `z` is exactly equal to the initial value `36 * y` plus the current value of `c`."**

### Explanation:

- `c` starts at 0 and increments by 1 only when `c < 36`.
- Hence, `c` can never exceed 36.
- `z` starts at `36 * y` and increments by 1 every time `c` increments.
- So `z = 36*y + c` remains true at the start and end of every iteration.
- This invariant fully describes the progression of the two variables `c` and `z`.
- It also establishes non-negativity of `z` since `y >= 0`.

---

## e. Establishment

- Before the first iteration:
  - `c = 0` which satisfies `0 <= c <= 36`.
  - `z = 36 * y + 0 = 36 * y`.
  - Given precondition `0 <= y <= 127`, so `36 * y >= 0`.
- Therefore, the invariant holds before entering the loop.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration:

  ```
  0 <= c <= 36
  z = 36 * y + c
  ```

- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns true.

- In the loop body:

  - If `c < 36`:
    - `c` increments by 1 → `c_new = c + 1 <= 36`
    - `z` increments by 1 → `z_new = z + 1 = 36 * y + c + 1`
    - So after iteration:

      ```
      c_new = c + 1 <= 36
      z_new = 36 * y + c_new
      ```

  - Else (`c >= 36`):
    - `if (c < 36)` condition is false, so no increments.
    - `c_new = c`, `z_new = z`, so invariant still holds.

- Thus, whether increments happen or not, invariant holds at end of iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false (or potentially never if non-terminating).

- At termination:

  - The invariant still holds:

    ```
    0 <= c <= 36
    z = 36 * y + c
    ```

  - Since `y >= 0`, `36 * y >= 0`

  - Thus:

    ```
    z = 36 * y + c >= 0 + 0 = 0
    ```

- Therefore, `z` is always non-negative.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- Post-condition is: `(c < 36) ==> (z >= 0)`.

- From the invariant and termination condition:

  - Regardless of whether `c < 36` or not, `z = 36 * y + c >= 0` since `y >= 0` and `c >= 0`.
  
- Hence, if `c < 36`, `z` is guaranteed non-negative; so the post-condition is **correct**.

- Proof via invariant:

  ```
  Invariant ∧ ¬unknown() (loop termination) ⇒
  0 <= c <= 36 ∧ z = 36*y + c ⇒
  if c < 36 then z >= 0
  ```

- So the invariant combined with loop termination implies the post-condition.

---

### **Summary of Loop Invariant**

```c
/*@ 
  invariant 0 <= c <= 36;
  invariant z == 36 * y + c;
*/
```

---

# Final Notes

- The purpose of the loop and the variables' relation is fully captured by the invariant expressing `c` bounds and `z` linear relation to `c`.
- This invariant is easily established, maintained, and sufficient to prove the post-condition.
- The unknown loop condition prevents predicting exact loop termination but does not affect the correctness of the invariant-based reasoning.

2025-12-23 02:51:54,710 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `0 <= \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 127 && (z == 36 * \at(y,Pre)) * (c == 0) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre)) * (x1 == \at(x1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`
