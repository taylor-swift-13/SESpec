void foo96(int x) {

    int j =0;
    int y =1;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

}
```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

This loop increments the variable `i` by 1 at every iteration starting from 0, continuing while `i` is less than or equal to the input parameter `x`. Simultaneously, it increments `j` by `y` (which is initialized to 1 and never changed). The loop essentially accumulates a total in `j` equal to `y` added once per iteration.

Intuitively, since `y=1` is constant, `j` should track `i` (the count of iterations), i.e., `j` increments by 1 every iteration just like `i` increments by 1. So `i` and `j` remain equal throughout the loop.

After the loop finishes, the assertion checks:

- If `i` is not equal to `j`, then `y` must not equal 1.

Because `y` is initialized to 1 and never changed, the assertion essentially states that if the final `i` and `j` differ, then `y` must have been changed — which with current code is not possible, so the assertion should hold.

---

**Loop Structure:**

- **Condition:** `while(i <= x)` — the loop continues as long as `i` is at most `x`.

- **Operations in body:**

    - `i = i + 1;` — increments `i` by 1
    - `j = j + y;` — increments `j` by `y`

- **Variables relevant to behavior:**

    - `i` (iterator incremented by 1 each iteration)
    - `j` (accumulates increments of `y` each iteration)
    - `y` (initialized to 1, stays constant unless changed outside this snippet)
    - `x` (loop bound controlling maximum `i`)

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We’ll track `(i, j, y)` values before the loop, after each of the first 5 iterations, and if applicable, after loop termination. Assume some arbitrary input `x >= 0`.

---

| Stage               | i  | j  | y | Comment                      |
|---------------------|----|----|---|------------------------------|
| Pre-loop            | 0  | 0  | 1 | Initial values                |
| After Iteration 1    | 1  | 1  | 1 | i and j both incremented by 1 |
| After Iteration 2    | 2  | 2  | 1 | i == j                       |
| After Iteration 3    | 3  | 3  | 1 | i == j                       |
| After Iteration 4    | 4  | 4  | 1 | i == j                       |
| After Iteration 5    | 5  | 5  | 1 | i == j                       |

---

**Termination:**

The loop continues until `i > x`. So at termination:

- `i == x + 1` (since loop continues while `i <= x`, incrementing `i` by 1 each iteration, it exits at `i = x + 1`)
- `j == y * (x + 1)` (since `j` increases by `y` each iteration starting 0)

If `y == 1`, then `j == i` at termination.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert (i != j) ==> (y != 1) ; */
```

This means: "If after the loop, `i` is not equal to `j`, then `y` must not be 1."

---

**Can this be part of the loop invariant?**

- No, this post-condition compares final `i` and `j` at loop termination. During the loop:

    - `i` and `j` are likely equal in all iterations (if `y=1`).
    - The assertion is about final values; during intermediate iterations, it may not hold (or the antecedent `(i != j)` is false).

- Therefore, the post-condition is not directly a loop invariant — it's a property that should hold after termination.

---

**Can this condition be modified into a valid invariant?**

We know the relation between `i` and `j` during the loop, especially knowing the value of `y`.

Given that:

- `j = y * i` at any iteration, since both start at 0 and increment together in this pattern.

So a better invariant candidate is:

```c
j == y * i
```

This relationship:

- Holds before the loop (both zero).
- Maintained after each iteration.
- At termination, `i = x + 1`, so `j = y * (x + 1)`.

Then the original assertion can be reasoned about by this invariant.

Specifically:

- If `y == 1`, then `i == j` always.
- Thus, `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` holds, because if the conclusion were false (`y == 1`), then antecedent (`i != j`) is false.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**

At the start and end of every loop iteration:

> "The value of `j` equals the value of `y` multiplied by `i`."

Formally:

```c
j == y * i
```

---

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- *Initialization:* Before the loop, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, so `j == y * i` → `0 == 1 * 0` → true.

- *Maintenance:* Each iteration increments `i` by 1 and `j` by `y`. Assuming `j == y * i` at the start, then after:

  - New `i = old_i + 1`
  - New `j = old_j + y = y * old_i + y = y * (old_i + 1)`

  So `j == y * i` remains true after increment.

- *Use at termination:* When loop terminates at `i = x + 1`, then `j = y * (x + 1)`.

This invariant perfectly captures the relationship between `i` and `j` throughout the loop.

---

## e. Establishment

- Before the loop starts, `i = 0` and `j = 0`.

- `y` is set to 1.

- `j == y * i` becomes `0 == 1 * 0`, which holds.

- Therefore, the invariant is **established** before the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration:

  ```c
  j == y * i
  ```

- Loop body executes:

  ```
  i = i + 1;
  j = j + y;
  ```

- After update:

  ```
  new_j = old_j + y = y * old_i + y = y * (old_i + 1)
  new_i = old_i + 1
  ```

- So:

  ```
  new_j == y * new_i
  ```

- Thus invariant holds at end of iteration if it held at the start.

- Because the loop condition depends only on `i` and `x`, and does not affect `j` or `y`, preservation is guaranteed.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- Loop exits when `i > x`.

- Since `i` increases from `0` to `x + 1`, when loop ends:

  ```
  i == x + 1
  ```

- From invariant:

  ```
  j == y * i == y * (x + 1)
  ```

- The invariant still holds at termination.

- Therefore, `j` is directly proportional to `i` and `y`, exactly matching the total increments done.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

The post-condition to verify:

```c
(i != j) ==> (y != 1)
```

---

**Is it correct?**

- If `y == 1`:

  - From invariant: `j == i` always.

  - So `i != j` is false.

  - So the implication `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` is true (because an implication with false antecedent is true).

- If `y != 1`:

  - `j = y * i` may differ from `i`, so `i != j` may be true.

  - Then the implication is true because the conclusion `(y != 1)` holds.

- Thus, **the post-condition is correct**.

---

**How does the invariant combined with loop termination imply the post-condition?**

- At termination, `j == y * i`.

- So, if `i != j`, it must be that `i != y * i`.

- If `i != 0`, this implies `y != 1` because otherwise `i == j`.

- If `i == 0` at termination (only possible if `x < 0` meaning loop never runs), then both `i` and `j` are 0, so `i == j`.

- Hence, the invariant ensures that the post-condition holds true as a logical consequence.

---

# **Summary of the Loop Invariant and its Verification**

```c
/*@
  loop invariant j == y * i;
*/
```

**Explanation:**

- Maintained before, during, and after the loop.
- Ensures linear relationship between `j` and `i`.
- Allows reasoning to prove that the assertion `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` holds after the loop terminates.
- Prevents any possible discrepancy between `i` and `j` unless `y != 1`.

2025-12-23 00:05:51,431 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(y == 1) * (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`
