### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop aims to decrement variable `x` repeatedly until `x` is no longer greater than 0. Initially, `x` is set equal to `n`. Since the loop only runs while `x > 0`, the expected outcome is that after the loop completes, `x` will be 0 or less. However, since `x` only decrements by 1 and does not skip any values, and given a non-negative initial `n`, the loop should terminate exactly when `x == 0`.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while (x > 0)` — the loop continues as long as `x` is strictly positive.
  
- **Loop body:** A single operation `x = x - 1;` which decrements `x` by 1.
  
- **Relevant variables:** 
  - `n` (input parameter, remains constant throughout)
  - `x` (control variable driven by the loop)
  
`n` is the initial value assigned to `x`, and the loop decreases `x` until the condition `x > 0` fails.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s assume an input `n >= 0`. For concrete samples, let’s pick `n = 5` (a positive integer to observe the loop behavior).

| Step                   | Value of `x` |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Pre-Loop Sampling      | 5            |
| After iteration 1      | 4            |
| After iteration 2      | 3            |
| After iteration 3      | 2            |
| After iteration 4      | 1            |
| After iteration 5      | 0            |
| Post-Loop Sampling     | 0 (loop ended because x = 0 ≤ 0) |

**Explanation:**

- Initially, `x = n = 5`.
- Each iteration decrements `x` by 1.
- The loop condition checks `x > 0` before each iteration.
- After fifth iteration, `x` reaches 0, causing `x > 0` to be false.
- Loop terminates with `x == 0`.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

```c
(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)
```

This asserts that if the input `n` is non-negative, then after the loop, `x` must be exactly zero.

**Can it be part of the loop invariant?**

- NO. The goal `x == 0` is **only true at loop termination**, not during iterations.
- During loop execution, `x` decreases but is often positive (e.g., 4, 3, 2...).
- Therefore, `x == 0` is false before termination, so it cannot be the loop invariant directly.

**Can it be modified into a valid invariant?**

Yes.

We want something that:

- Holds before the first iteration (pre-loop).
- Holds after each iteration.
- Combined with `!(x > 0)` implies `x == 0`.

A natural candidate invariant relates `x` to `n` and ensures no overshoot:

> **Invariant Candidate:**  
> `0 <= x <= n`

This invariant means `x` always stays between zero and `n`.

- At start, `x == n` so `0 <= x <= n` holds if `n >= 0`.
- In each iteration, `x` decreases by exactly 1 but remains ≥ 0 while loop runs.
- When loop ends, `x` satisfies `x <= 0`, but `x >= 0` from invariant means `x == 0`.
- Thus, combined with loop termination condition `x <= 0` or `!(x > 0)`, the invariant implies `x == 0`.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language):**

- "`x` is an integer value between 0 and `n` inclusive at the start and end of every loop iteration."

**Explanation of Validity:**

- Initially, `x = n`, so clearly `0 <= x <= n` if `n >= 0`.
- The loop body decreases `x` by 1 each iteration, so `x` remains within range or decreases by exactly 1.
- The invariant ensures the loop does not underflow below 0 during execution.
- This invariant is maintained at every iteration and at termination.
- Once the loop condition fails (`x <= 0`), the invariant forces `x == 0` (because it cannot be less than 0).

---

### e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established before the loop?**

- Before the loop, `x = n`.
- If `n >= 0` (precondition), then obviously `0 <= x <= n` holds because `x == n`.
- Thus, the invariant is **established** before the first iteration because it holds at initialization.

---

### f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved in each iteration?**

Assuming:

- At the start of some iteration, `0 <= x <= n`.
- The loop condition `x > 0` is true; so `x ≥ 1` as `x` must be strictly positive.

Then:

- The loop body executes `x = x - 1`.
- New value is `x_new = x - 1`.
- Since original `x ≥ 1`, `x_new ≥ 0`.
- Also, since original `x ≤ n`, `x_new ≤ n` still holds (decrementing by 1 cannot exceed `n`).
- Thus `0 <= x_new <= n`.
  
Hence, **invariant is preserved** after the iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**Condition when loop terminates:**

- The loop terminates when `!(x > 0)`, i.e., `x <= 0`.
- From the invariant, `x` is always ≥ 0.
- So the only possibility at termination is `x == 0`.

**Loop invariant validity at termination:**

- Since invariant ensures `0 <= x <= n`, and loop exit implies `x <= 0`, these together imply `x == 0`.
- Therefore, invariant remains valid and precisely identifies the final state of `x`.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Is the post-condition correct?**

```c
(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)
```

- Yes, this is correct.
- The loop invariant (`0 <= x <= n`) combined with loop exit predicate (`x <= 0`) implies `x == 0`.
- Thus, for any non-negative input, after decrementing until `x <= 0`, `x` is guaranteed to be 0.
- The post-condition is a valid assertion of the program state after the loop terminates.

**Connection:**

- Invariant + Negation of loop condition ⇒ `x == 0`
- Therefore, the post-condition holds whenever pre-condition (`n >= 0`) is satisfied.

---

### Summary of the Loop Invariant and Its Formal Properties:

| Property       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invariant      | `0 <= x <= n`                                                               |
| Establishment  | True before loop starts since `x = n` and `n >= 0`                         |
| Preservation   | If `0 <= x <= n` and `x > 0`, decrementing `x` by 1 keeps `0 <= x_new <= n`|
| Termination    | Loop exits when `x <= 0`. Together with invariant implies `x == 0`          |
| Post-condition | `(n >= 0) => (x == 0)` holds based on invariant and loop exit condition     |

If you'd like, I can help write the corresponding formal annotation (`loop invariant`) for tools like Frama-C or ACSL as well. Would you like me to do that?
