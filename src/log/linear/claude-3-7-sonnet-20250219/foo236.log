### Given Code Snippet

```c
void foo236() {
    unsigned int x;
    x = 268435440;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */
    while (x > 0) {
        x -= 2;
    }

    /*@ assert x % 2 == 0; */
}
```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop’s goal is to repeatedly decrement the unsigned integer variable `x` by 2 while `x` remains greater than zero.
- This process continues until `x` is no longer positive (i.e., `x <= 0`).
- After the loop, the program asserts that the final value of `x` is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).

**Loop Structure:**

- **Loop condition:** `while (x > 0)` — the loop continues as long as `x` is strictly positive.
- **Loop body:** `x -= 2;` — in each iteration, `x` is decreased by 2.
- **Relevant variables:** 
  - `x` (unsigned int) — initialized to a large number (268,435,440), decremented by 2 each iteration.
- There are no other data structures or control flow inside the loop.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We start with:

- Initial value: `x = 268435440`

We will sample `x` before the loop, then after iterations 1 through 5, and after loop termination if applicable.

| Sample Point         | Value of x        | Explanation                                      |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-Loop            | 268,435,440       | Initial value assigned before loop starts.     |
| After Iteration 1   | 268,435,438       | Decreased by 2 from initial value.              |
| After Iteration 2   | 268,435,436       | Decreased by 2 again.                            |
| After Iteration 3   | 268,435,434       | Continuing decrement by 2.                       |
| After Iteration 4   | 268,435,432       | Continuing decrement by 2.                       |
| After Iteration 5   | 268,435,430       | Continuing decrement by 2.                       |

Since the initial `x` is very large, the loop will not finish within these 5 iterations.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**

- Eventually, the loop terminates when `x` becomes `0` or negative.
- Since `x` is unsigned, subtracting 2 repeatedly will eventually cause `x` to reach 0 exactly (because the starting value is even).

When terminating:

| Termination State    | Value of x        | Explanation                                      |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Loop Exit            | 0                 | Loop stops because `x > 0` condition is false. |

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert x % 2 == 0; */
```

- This asserts that when the loop finishes, `x` is even.

**Can verification goal serve as invariant?**

- **No**, it cannot be the invariant itself, because:

  - Before the first iteration, `x` is 268,435,440 which is even (true).
  - After each iteration, we subtract 2 (which preserves even parity).
  - The condition `x % 2 == 0` holds before the first iteration and after each iteration.
  
So *actually*, the parity condition **is** invariant for this loop because subtracting 2 preserves evenness.

- However, the **goal** is stated as an assert after the loop, so:

  - The condition can serve as an invariant condition that helps prove the post-condition.
  - The goal is part of the invariant, but the invariant itself can include the loop condition for completeness.

**Modifying the verification goal:**

- No modification necessary: `x % 2 == 0` is established before the loop, preserved during execution, and holds at termination.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

- "`x` is always a nonnegative even number during the loop execution."

**Explanation why this invariant is valid:**

- Initially, `x` is `268,435,440` which is even and nonnegative.
- Each iteration subtracts 2 which preserves parity (subtracting an even number preserves evenness).
- The loop condition `x > 0` ensures `x` does not become negative inside the loop.
- Therefore, at the start and end of every iteration, `x` is a nonnegative even number.
- When the loop ends, `x` must be 0 (the smallest nonnegative even number).

---

## e. Establishment

**How invariant is established:**

- Before the first iteration, `x` is initialized to `268,435,440`.
- Since the starting value is even (`268,435,440 % 2 == 0` is true) and `x >= 0`, the invariant holds before the first iteration.
- Therefore, the initial condition guarantees the invariant.

---

## f. Preservation

**How invariant is preserved:**

- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `x` is nonnegative and even.
- The loop condition `x > 0` means `x` is strictly positive before the iteration.
- Inside the loop, `x` is updated by `x = x - 2`.
- Since subtracting 2 from a positive even number yields a nonnegative even number (if positive, it remains positive or reaches zero or just above zero).
- Thus, after subtracting 2, `x` remains even and nonnegative.
- Therefore, the invariant holds again at the end of each iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**Loop termination condition:**

- The loop ends when `x > 0` is false; i.e., `x <= 0`.
- Since `x` is unsigned, `x` can only be ≥ 0.
- After the last iteration, `x` equals exactly 0 (because starting from an even number and subtracting 2 repeatedly must eventually reach zero).
  
**Invariant validity at termination:**

- The invariant states `x` is even and nonnegative before every iteration, including the last.
- At termination, `x = 0` which is even and nonnegative.
- Thus, the invariant remains valid at loop termination.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Correctness of the post-condition:**

- The post-condition is `x % 2 == 0`.
- Based on the invariant and termination condition, this is true since:
  - Loop invariant guarantees `x` is even throughout.
  - At termination, `x = 0` which satisfies the post-condition.

**How invariant + negation of loop condition proves post-condition:**

- Invariant: `x` is even and nonnegative.
- Negation of loop condition: `!(x > 0)` ⇒ `x <= 0`.
- Since `x` is unsigned, `x` can only be `0` here.
- `x = 0` satisfies `x % 2 == 0`.
- Therefore, invariant + `x <= 0` ⇒ post-condition `x % 2 == 0`.
- The assertion is thus correct and proven.

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a. Purpose        | Loop decrements `x` by 2 until `x` ≤ 0, at which point `x` is 0 or even.      |
| b. Samples        | `x` starts at 268,435,440 and decreases by 2 each iteration, staying even.   |
| c. Verification   | Post-condition `x % 2 == 0` holds initially, preserved by loop; suitable as invariant. |
| d. Invariant      | "`x` remains a nonnegative even integer throughout the loop."                 |
| e. Establishment  | Initial `x` is even and nonnegative ⇒ invariant true at start.                |
| f. Preservation   | Subtracting 2 keeps `x` even and nonnegative during iterations.               |
| g. Termination    | Loop ends when `x == 0` (even); invariant still holds.                        |
| h. Post-condition | `x % 2 == 0` is true at loop exit; invariant + termination confirm correctness.|
