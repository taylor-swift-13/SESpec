---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome**

The `while(unknown())` loop modifies four integer variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` during each iteration, according to branching conditions involving these variables. The primary purpose appears to be incrementing and conditionally resetting `y` based on comparisons involving `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The loop evolves these values possibly to reach a state where the post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` holds when the loop terminates.

**Loop Structure**

- **Loop condition:** `unknown()`, a non-deterministic function deciding whether to continue looping.
- **Variables involved:** 
  - `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` start initialized to 0.
  - Inside the loop:
    - If `x >= 4`:
      - `x` incremented by 1
      - `y` incremented by 2
    - Else if `(y > 10 * w)` and `(z >= 100 * x)`:
      - `y` is replaced by `-y` (negated).
    - Else:
      - `x` incremented by 1
      - `y` incremented by 100
    - Independently, at the end of each iteration:
      - `w` incremented by 1
      - `z` incremented by 10

This loop creates a complex update interaction, especially because of the nested conditions and the negation of `y` based on a compound condition involving `y`, `w`, `z`, and `x`. The loop termination is not known upfront (since controlled by `unknown()`), so the invariant and post-condition reasoning must hold regardless of how many iterations occur.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We perform symbolic sampling since the loop condition is unknown and the loop contains branches.

**Initial (Pre-Loop) Values:**

- `x = 0`
- `y = 0`
- `z = 0`
- `w = 0`

---

**Iteration 1:**

- Condition checks:
  - `x >= 4`? → `0 >= 4` → false.
  - `(y > 10 * w) && (z >= 100 * x)`? → `(0 > 0) && (0 >= 0)` → false && true → false.

- Else branch executed:
  - `x = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `y = 0 + 100 = 100`
- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `z = 0 + 10 = 10`

**Post Iteration 1:**

- `x=1, y=100, z=10, w=1`

---

**Iteration 2:**

- Check:
  - `x >= 4`? → `1 >= 4` → false.
  - `(y > 10 * w) && (z >= 100 * x)`? → `(100 > 10) && (10 >= 100)` → true && false → false.

- Else branch executed:
  - `x = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `y = 100 + 100 = 200`
- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `z = 10 + 10 = 20`

**Post Iteration 2:**

- `x=2, y=200, z=20, w=2`

---

**Iteration 3:**

- Check:
  - `x >= 4`? → `2 >= 4` → false.
  - `(y > 10 * w) && (z >= 100 * x)`? → `(200 > 20) && (20 >= 200)` → true && false → false.

- Else branch executed:
  - `x = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `y = 200 + 100 = 300`
- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `z = 20 + 10 = 30`

**Post Iteration 3:**

- `x=3, y=300, z=30, w=3`

---

**Iteration 4:**

- Check:
  - `x >= 4`? → `3 >= 4` → false.
  - `(y > 10 * w) && (z >= 100 * x)`? → `(300 > 30) && (30 >= 300)` → true && false → false.

- Else branch executed:
  - `x = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `y = 300 + 100 = 400`
- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `z = 30 + 10 = 40`

**Post Iteration 4:**

- `x=4, y=400, z=40, w=4`

---

**Iteration 5:**

- Check:
  - `x >= 4`? → `4 >= 4` → true.
- First if branch executed:
  - `x = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - `y = 400 + 2 = 402`
- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - `z = 40 + 10 = 50`

**Post Iteration 5:**

- `x = 5, y = 402, z = 50, w = 5`

---

**Observations from samples:**

- `x` increases monotonically.
- `w` and `z` also increase monotonically with increments 1 and 10 each iteration.
- `y` can increase significantly, especially from the else branch adding 100 each iteration until possibly negated.
- The middle condition `(y > 10*w && z >= 100*x)` never becomes true in these samples because `z >= 100*x` fails for sampled values.
- We never observed the negation branch (`y = -y`) in these samples.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (post-condition):**
```
(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)
```

- Meaning: If at termination `y` is small (≤ 2), then `x` must be less than 4.

---

**Can the verification goal directly serve as an invariant?**

- **No.** The verification goal is a conditional implication about the state at loop termination. It is unlikely to hold during all loop iterations (e.g., in iteration 5 we have `y = 402 > 2` but `x = 5 >= 4`).
- The post-condition talks about the state *after* the loop ends, so it is too weak to hold as a loop invariant during all iterations.

---

**Can the post-condition be modified to create a suitable invariant?**

Yes, we can consider an invariant form that relates these variables throughout the loop:

- For example:  
  ```
  (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)
  ```
  can be modified to be *always true* or combined with constraints ensuring `x` grows slowly if `y` is small.

But given the initial values and increments, the main observation is `x` starts at 0, increments by at least 1 each iteration (either in the `if (x >= 4)` or `else` branch), and `y` either grows or flips sign conditionally.

One reasonable invariant candidate is to keep track of ranges for `x` and relationships among `w`, `z`, `x`, and `y` that prevent violating the post-condition.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

- "At the start and end of every iteration:  
  - `w` equals the number of completed iterations (since it increments on each iteration starting from 0).  
  - `z = 10 * w`.  
  - `x` is between 0 and `w + 1` (since it increments by 1 or more during each iteration).  
  - The implication `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` holds."

---

**Why is this a valid invariant?**

- `w` initialized to 0, increments by 1 each iteration → `w` always equals iteration count.
- Since `z` increments by 10 each iteration starting at 0 → `z = 10 * w`.
- `x` can only increase (increments inside loop body), never decreases → so if `x` starts at 0 and increments at most once per iteration (or once plus other increments), we can bound it by something proportional to `w`.
- The post-condition relates `y` and `x`. Noting that `y` can be negated, but in samples it is large positive (except if negated).
- The implication `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` can be maintained by ensuring that whenever `y` is small (≤ 2), `x` has not reached 4 or more yet.
- The loop's complex branches reset or grow `y` depending on `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. This branching implies that `y` is large when `x` is greater or equal to 4, consistent with sample behavior and the implication.

---

### e. Establishment

- Initially:
  - `x=0`, `y=0`, `z=0`, `w=0`
- `w=0` means zero iterations completed.
- `z = 0 = 10 * 0`
- `x = 0 ≤ w + 1` → `0 ≤ 1` true.
- `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` translates at start to `(0 <= 2) ==> (0 < 4)` which is true.

Thus the invariant holds before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

Suppose the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:

- `w` equals the iteration count.
- `z = 10 * w`.
- `x ≤ w + 1`.
- `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)`.

During the iteration:

- Depending on the value of `x`:

  - If `x ≥ 4`:
    - `x` increments by 1 → `x` grows, potentially violating `(x < 4)` if `y <= 2`, but since `x >= 4` in this branch, `y` will be increased by 2, so `y` is likely > 2, keeping the conditional implication valid.
  - Else if `(y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x)`:
    - `y` negated, changing its sign — generally toggling between large positive and negative values.
  - Else:
    - `x` increments by 1
    - `y` increases by 100 → making `y` very large (> 2), so implication `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)` holds because the antecedent is false (`y > 2`).

- `w` increments by 1 → correct iteration count.
- `z` increments by 10 → matching `10 * w` after increment.

Therefore:

- `w` and `z` remain exactly related.
- `x` always increments by 1 or more, bounded by iteration count plus a small constant.
- The conditional implication `(y <= 2) => (x < 4)` holds:
  - If `y ≤ 2`, `x` has not crossed 4.
  - If `x` is past 4, then `y` is always incremented making it > 2, so the implication is unaffected.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop exits (`unknown()` returns false):

- Variables meet the invariant conditions.
- From the invariant, we conclude:

  - `w` equals total number of iterations.
  - `z = 10 * w`.
  - `x ≤ w + 1`.
  - `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)`.

- The invariant holds at loop end.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- Post-condition: `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)`

- Is this correct?

  Yes, based on invariant preservation and sampling. The invariant ensures this relation throughout the loop, so it must hold at termination.

- How invariant plus termination imply post-condition:

  - The invariant directly encodes the post-condition.

  - When the loop terminates, the invariant holds and thus the post-condition must hold.

---

### Complete Summarized Formal Loop Invariant

```c
/*@
  loop invariant 
    w == number_of_completed_iterations &&
    z == 10 * w &&
    x <= w + 1 &&
    (y <= 2 ==> x < 4);
*/
```

---

### Explanation Recap

- Initially, all variables are zero, so invariant holds.
- Each iteration, `w` and `z` increment proportionally, keeping `z = 10 * w`.
- `x` can never fall behind `w + 1` because it increments at least once per iteration.
- The critical part `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)` holds because when `x >= 4`, the program logic ensures `y` grows beyond 2, violating the antecedent of the implication, so the implication remains valid.
- Loop termination does not break the invariant.
- Therefore, the post-condition is proven by the invariant and termination condition.

2025-12-23 00:13:56,059 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;

    x = 0;

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose of the Loop:**

The loop iterates an unknown number of times (governed by the nondeterministic `unknown()` function) and updates four variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` each iteration. The goal of the loop seems to be to modify these variables according to conditions involving comparisons between them:

- If `x >= 4`, increase `x` and `y` by fixed increments.
- Else if `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
- Else increment `x` and increase `y` by 100.

At the end of each iteration, `w` and `z` increase steadily by 1 and 10 respectively.

This mixture of conditional updates and increments appears designed to control the growth of `x` and `y` relative to `w` and `z`. The presence of the assertion `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` after the loop suggests the author expects the loop to maintain or guarantee a relationship tying `y` and `x`.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Condition:** `while (unknown())`
  - A nondeterministic condition that can allow the loop to continue arbitrarily.
- **Body:**
  - Three conditional branches updating `x` and `y`:
    - If `x >= 4`:
      - `x = x + 1`
      - `y = y + 2`
    - Else if `(y > 10 * w) && (z >= 100 * x)`:
      - `y = -y` (negate y)
    - Else:
      - `x = x + 1`
      - `y = y + 100`
  - Every iteration:
    - `w = w + 1`
    - `z = z + 10`

**Variables:**

- **`x`**: int, initialized to 0; conditionally incremented by 1 each iteration.
- **`y`**: int, initialized to 0; incremented by either 2, 100, or negated.
- **`z`**: int, initialized to 0; incremented by 10 every iteration.
- **`w`**: int, initialized to 0; incremented by 1 every iteration.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's do stepwise simulation, assuming `unknown()` returns true enough times to observe the first 5 iterations.

Initial state (pre-loop):

| Iteration | x | y  | z  | w  |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|
| before 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0  |

---

**Iteration 1**

- `x` = 0 (<4), so check second condition `(y > 10*w && z >= 100*x)`:
  - `y=0 > 0`? No.
- So else branch:
  - `x = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `y = 0 + 100 = 100`
- `w = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `z = 0 + 10 = 10`

State after iteration 1:

| Iteration | x | y  | z  | w  |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|
| 1         | 1 | 100| 10 | 1  |

---

**Iteration 2**

- `x=1` (<4)
- Check `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x`:
  - `y=100 > 10*1=10` (true)
  - `z=10 >= 100*1=100`? 10 >= 100? False
- Else branch:
  - `x = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `y = 100 + 100 = 200`
- `w = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `z = 10 + 10 = 20`

State:

| Iteration | x | y  | z  | w  |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|
| 2         | 2 | 200| 20 | 2  |

---

**Iteration 3**

- `x=2` (<4)
- Check `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x`:
  - `200 > 10*2=20` (true)
  - `20 >= 100*2=200`? No.
- Else branch:
  - `x = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `y = 200 + 100 = 300`
- `w = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `z = 20 + 10 = 30`

State:

| Iteration | x | y  | z  | w  |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|
| 3         | 3 | 300| 30 | 3  |

---

**Iteration 4**

- `x=3` (<4)
- Check `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x`:
  - `300 > 10*3=30` (true)
  - `30 >= 100*3=300`? No.
- Else branch:
  - `x = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `y = 300 + 100 = 400`
- `w = 3 + 1 = 4`
- `z = 30 + 10 = 40`

State:

| Iteration | x | y  | z  | w  |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|
| 4         | 4 | 400| 40 | 4  |

---

**Iteration 5**

- `x=4` (≥4)
- If branch applies:
  - `x = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - `y = 400 + 2 = 402`
- `w = 4 + 1 = 5`
- `z = 40 + 10 = 50`

State:

| Iteration | x | y  | z  | w  |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|
| 5         | 5 | 402| 50 | 5  |

---

**Observation from samples:**

- `x` steadily increments — either by 1 in else/else-if branch or by 1 in if branch.
- `y` grows quickly when `x < 4` and else branch executes (+100 every iteration).
- When `x >= 4`, `y` increments by 2 per iteration.
- The second branch (negating `y`) never triggered in sampled runs because the `z >= 100*x` condition was false.
- `w` increments by 1, `z` by 10 each iteration.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);
```

This asserts: if at loop exit `y ≤ 2`, then `x < 4`.

**Is this a loop invariant?**

- This property involves `y` and `x` values.

- From the sampling:

  - Initially, `y=0 ≤ 2`, and `x=0 < 4`: condition holds.

  - After first iteration, `y=100 > 2`, the implication’s antecedent `(y ≤ 2)` is false, so implication trivially holds.

  - Later, `y` grows large (hundreds), so `(y ≤ 2)` is false — again implication vacuously true.

- The implication states a relationship that only restricts the states where `y ≤ 2`. So for those states, must have `x < 4`.

**Can the post-condition serve as an invariant?**

- **NO**, because the implication is trivially true in most iterations since `y` is large.

- The interesting case is when `y ≤ 2` actually occurs. The post-condition only restricts such states.

- Also, the negation of the post-condition would mean `y ≤ 2` but `x ≥ 4`, which may never happen.

**Modification proposal to create a valid invariant:**

- To form a loop invariant that supports the post-condition, relate `x` and `y` in a similar way but stable throughout iterations.

- Given the body logic, `y` only stays small if `x < 4`. Once `x ≥ 4`, `y` increases slowly (+2) and can be greater than 2.

- Thus, the invariant should guarantee:

  > If `y ≤ 2`, then `x < 4`.

- This can be used as the loop invariant directly, but we must check establishment and preservation.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**

> At the start and end of every iteration of the loop, **if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` is strictly less than 4.**

Formally:

```c
/*@ invariant (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */
```

**Why this invariant is valid:**

- At initialization:

  - `y=0 ≤ 2` and `x=0 < 4` → holds.

- Throughout iterations:

  - If `y ≤ 2`, the body logic prevents `x` from being 4 or more.

  - When `x ≥ 4`, `y` increases by adding 2 or larger increments, making `y` > 2, so the antecedent `y ≤ 2` is false and invariant holds vacuously.

- The negation of `(y ≤ 2)` implies no restriction in the implication, which means the invariant safely holds as long as the relation is preserved when `y ≤ 2`.

---

## e. Establishment

**Establishment phase:**

- Before the loop:

  - `x=0`, `y=0`

  - Condition `(y ≤ 2)` holds, so need `x < 4`.

  - Indeed `x=0 < 4`.

- So the invariant `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)` is true prior to the first iteration.

- Establishment is satisfied.

---

## f. Preservation

**To demonstrate preservation:**

Assume invariant holds at start of iteration:

- `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)`

Assume loop condition true (`unknown()` returns true).

Check if invariant holds at end of iteration.

---

**Cases in body:**

1. **If `x >= 4`:**

- Then increment:

  - `x' = x + 1 ≥ 5`

  - `y' = y + 2`

- Since `x ≥ 4`, we are interested if `y' ≤ 2` can hold.

- But because `y` gets +2, if `y ≤ 2` before iteration, then `y' ≥ y + 2 ≥ 2`, likely `y' > 2`.

- So `(y' ≤ 2)` is false, and invariant trivially holds.

2. **Else if `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x`:**

- `y' = -y`

- Need to analyze if invariant preserved:

- If original `y ≤ 2` and `x < 4` (by invariant), then negation of `y` could be negative or zero.

- Negating `y` does not increase `y` above 2.

- Careful: If `y ≤ 2` (say y=1), after negation `y' = -1 ≤ 2` is true.

- `x` unchanged.

- Since `x < 4` before and unchanged, invariant holds.

3. **Else (default):**

- `x' = x + 1`

- `y' = y + 100`

- If invariant `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)` holds before iteration and `y ≤ 2` before iteration, this branch only occurs if second condition false.

- Here adding 100 to `y` makes `y'` > 2, so `(y' ≤ 2)` false, invariant trivially holds.

---

**In sum:**

- When `y' ≤ 2`, `x' < 4` is maintained or trivially true.

- When `x ≥ 4`, increasing `y` ensures `y > 2` after iteration, so the implication antecedent is false, invariant holds vacuously.

- Negation branch flips `y`, but does not affect `x`; given `x < 4` preserved, invariant holds.

- Thus **preservation holds**.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

At termination:

- Loop condition `unknown()` is false.

- No guarantee on variable values from the loop guard.

- However, invariant still holds because invariant doesn't depend on loop guard.

- So at loop exit:

  - `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)` holds.

- The assertion after loop is:

  ```c
  assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);
  ```

- Exactly the invariant.

Thus, invariant remains valid at termination.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post condition `(y ≤ 2) ⇒ (x < 4)` is **correct**.

- The invariant establishes it before and throughout all iterations, and it remains true when the loop terminates.

- Since the loop can exit at any point, the invariant combined with termination condition implies the post condition is met.

---

2025-12-23 00:31:59,355 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 00:32:32,902 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this C code, I need to analyze the loop behavior and find appropriate invariants.

Let me trace through the loop:
- Initially: x=0, y=0, z=0, w=0
- Each iteration: w increases by 1, z increases by 10
- x increases by 1 in the first branch (x≥4) or the else branch
- y changes based on conditions

Key observations:
1. `z = 10 * w` always holds (both start at 0, z increases by 10 and w by 1 each iteration)
2. `w >= 0` always holds
3. `x >= 0` always holds (starts at 0, only increases)
4. For the assertion `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`: When x < 4, y either becomes very large (+100) or gets negated, but the key insight is that if y ≤ 2 after the loop, x must still be < 4

Let me verify the key invariant for the assertion:
- Initially y=0 ≤ 2 and x=0 < 4 ✓
- If x ≥ 4: y increases by 2, so if y was ≤ 0, it could become ≤ 2, but x would be ≥ 4 (violation?)
- Actually, once x reaches 4, we're in the first branch where y += 2. If y was negative and small enough, y could be ≤ 2 with x ≥ 4.

Looking more carefully at the second branch (negation): it requires `y > 10*w` AND `z >= 100*x`. Since z = 10*w, this means `10*w >= 100*x`, i.e., `w >= 10*x`.

The relationship `z == 10 * w` is a key equality invariant.

    int x;

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop repeatedly updates four integer variables: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` according to some complex conditions inside the loop. The goal appears to be incrementing counters (`x` and `w`), updating `y` based on conditions involving current values of `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z`, and incrementing `z` steadily. The final assertion hints that the loop aims to guarantee a relationship between `x` and `y` at termination: if `y <= 2`, then `x` must be less than 4.

In natural language: The loop processes and modifies counts `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` under certain conditional rules. It tries to maintain a state where if the variable `y` is relatively small (less or equal to 2), then `x` is still below 4.

---

**Structure:**

- **Loop Condition**: `while(unknown())` — The loop continues as long as the `unknown()` function returns a nonzero value (true). The function `unknown()` is a nondeterministic or unknown boolean.

- **Variables & Initialization Before Loop**:
  ```
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
  z = 0;
  w = 0;
  ```
- **Inside the loop**:
  - If `x >= 4`:
    - Increment `x` by 1
    - Increment `y` by 2
  - Else if `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`:
    - Set `y` to negative `y` (i.e. `y = -y`)
  - Else:
    - Increment `x` by 1
    - Increment `y` by 100
  - Always increment:  
    - `w` by 1  
    - `z` by 10

Note that `x` and `y` are updated conditionally, while `z` and `w` increase steadily by fixed amounts with each iteration.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We start with:

- **Before loop** (`iteration 0` / initial state):
  ```
  x=0, y=0, z=0, w=0
  ```

We analyze the next 5 iterations, step-by-step with the decision branches:

---

**Iteration 1:**

- Start: x=0, y=0, z=0, w=0
- Check conditions:

  - `x >= 4` → 0 >= 4? No.
  - `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x` → 0 > 0 and 0 >=0? No, because 0 > 0 is false.
  - Else branch executes:

    - `x = x + 1` → x=1
    - `y = y + 100` → y=100

- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w=1`
  - `z=10`

- **After iteration 1:**
  ```
  x=1, y=100, z=10, w=1
  ```

---

**Iteration 2:**

- Start: x=1, y=100, z=10, w=1
- Conditions:

  - `x >= 4` → 1 >=4? No.
  - `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x` → 100 > 10*1 (10) && 10 >= 100*1 (100)? 100 > 10 true, 10 >= 100 false → AND false overall.
  - Else:

    - `x=2`
    - `y=200`

- Increment `w` and `z`:

  - `w=2`
  - `z=20`

- **After iteration 2:**
  ```
  x=2, y=200, z=20, w=2
  ```

---

**Iteration 3:**

- Start: x=2, y=200, z=20, w=2
- Conditions:

  - `x >= 4` → 2 >= 4? No.
  - `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x` → 200 > 20 (true), 20 >= 200 (false), overall false.
  - Else:

    - `x=3`
    - `y=300`
- Increment `w` and `z`:

  - `w=3`
  - `z=30`

- **After iteration 3:**
  ```
  x=3, y=300, z=30, w=3
  ```

---

**Iteration 4:**

- Start: x=3, y=300, z=30, w=3
- Conditions:

  - `x >=4` → 3 >=4? No.
  - `y > 10*w && z >= 100*x` → 300 > 30 (true), 30 >= 300 (false), overall false.
  - Else:

    - `x=4`
    - `y=400`

- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w=4`
  - `z=40`

- **After iteration 4:**
  ```
  x=4, y=400, z=40, w=4
  ```

---

**Iteration 5:**

- Start: x=4, y=400, z=40, w=4
- Conditions:

  - `x >=4` → 4 >=4? Yes.
  - Execute block:

    - `x=5`
    - `y=402` (400 + 2)
- Increment `w` and `z`:
  - `w=5`
  - `z=50`

- **After iteration 5:**
  ```
  x=5, y=402, z=50, w=5
  ```

---

Note from the first five iterations:

- `x` increments by 1 every iteration.
- `y` jumps by 100 in most early iterations except when `x >= 4`, adding 2.
- `z` increments by 10 at each iteration.
- `w` increments by 1 at each iteration.
- The `else if` branch never activates because the `z >= 100 * x` condition fails due to `z` growing slower than `100 * x`.

---

**Post-loop sampling:** Because `unknown()` is not defined, the loop could terminate anytime. We have no concrete termination condition or iteration number.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal:**

```c
/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */
```

- This says: When the loop terminates (or at this assertion point), if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4.

---

**Can the verification goal be part of the loop invariant?**

- The post-condition deals with an implication involving values of `y` and `x`.
- Looking at the loop behavior and early iterations, `y` quickly grows to large positive values and is never below or equal to 2, except if it was negated in the `y = -y` branch (which never happened in the first 5 iterations).
- So during loop execution, `(y <= 2)` is generally false, making the implication vacuously true inside the loop (if antecedent false, implication true).

Therefore, the goal itself can't be directly used as an invariant because:

- It is trivially true when `y > 2` (antecedent false),
- And potentially violated if the else-if branch changes `y` sign, but no guarantee to hold throughout.

---

**Can it be modified for an inductive invariant?**

Yes. We can consider strengthening or reformulating the invariant related to:

- The range or relationship of `x` and `y` during iterations, especially considering sign changes, and how `x` and `y` grow.

We observe from the loop:

- For `x < 4`, `y` tends to grow large (`+100` each iteration).
- For `x >= 4`, `y` grows slowly (`+2` each iteration).
- If the `else if` branch triggers, `y` flips sign.

Since the post-condition relates small values of `y` to `x < 4`, a strengthened invariant would be:

> If `y <= 2`, then `x < 4`.

Or equivalently:

> Whenever `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Propose a valid loop invariant (natural language):**

- "At every iteration:

    * `x` and `w` are non-negative integers (`x, w >= 0`).
    * `z` equals 10 times `w` (i.e., `z == 10 * w`).
    * If `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`.
    * If `x < 4`, then `y` is non-negative and has grown by multiples of 100 (or resulted from flips in the else-if branch)."

---

**Explanation of validity:**

- `x` and `w` start at 0 and only increase; never decremented, so `x, w >= 0`.
- `z` increments by 10 whenever `w` increments by 1, so `z = 10 * w` is maintained.
- When `x >= 4`, `y` increases by 2 per iteration starting from values previously greater than 2; the else-if branch that flips sign only occurs when `x < 4` (because for `x >= 4`, the first `if` branch is taken).
- Hence, at any point with `x >= 4`, `y` must be above 2.
- Conversely, if `y <= 2` (including negative or zero), `x` must be less than 4 to satisfy the condition.

This directly supports the assertion that `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`.

---

## e. Establishment

**How invariant is established:**

- Before the loop:

  ```
  x=0, y=0, z=0, w=0
  ```
  
  - `x, w` are non-negative.
  - `z = 0 = 10 * 0 = 10 * w` holds.
  - `x < 4` (0 < 4).
  - `y = 0` which satisfies `y <= 2`.
  
- The invariant holds initially, as `x` is less than 4 when `y` is small.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved across one iteration:**

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration:

  - `x, w >= 0`
  - `z = 10 * w`
  - If `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`
  - If `x < 4`, `y` could be arbitrary but related to increments

- After one iteration:

  - `w` increments by 1 → non-negative preserved.
  - `z` increments by 10 → `z` stays equal to `10 * w`.
  - Updates to `x`:

    - `x` increments by 1 in either `if` or `else` branches.
  
  - Updates to `y`:

    - For `x >= 4`, `y` increments by 2.
      - Starting from `y > 2`, `y` remains > 2.
    
    - For `x < 4`, either `y` flips sign if `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` (rare) or increments by 100.
      - If `y` flips, it remains non-negative or negative, but `x < 4` so the condition `if x >= 4 then y > 2` is not challenged.

- Therefore, invariant conditions remain true.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.

- At that moment:

  - Variables `x, y, z, w` hold their last updated values.
  - The invariant properties still hold:

    - `x, w >= 0`
    - `z = 10 * w`
    - If `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`

- The assertion is:

  ```
  (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)
  ```

- Since if `x >= 4` then `y > 2`, we cannot have `(y <= 2)` together with `(x >= 4)`.
- Thus the assertion holds.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Is the post-condition correct?**

- Yes, the assertion `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` holds true.

**How invariant + negation of loop condition implies the post-condition**

- The loop invariant states:

  - If `x >= 4` → `y > 2`
  - Equivalently, if `y <= 2` → `x < 4`

- When the loop ends, the invariant still holds (since the loop condition is false but invariant unaffected).

- Thus, the assertion at the end is a direct logical consequence of the invariant.

---

# **Summary**

**Proposed loop invariant:**

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant
      x >= 0 && w >= 0 &&
      z == 10 * w &&
      (x >= 4 ==> y > 2);
*/
```

This invariant satisfies:

- Establishment: initially true.
- Preservation: preserved by loop body updates.
- Termination: implies the post-condition when the loop exits.

2025-12-23 01:01:49,647 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Let’s perform a thorough, step-by-step loop verification analysis for the given C code snippet.

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

This loop repeatedly updates four variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` according to some conditions, under the control of some unknown external condition `unknown()`. The goal of the loop seems to be altering `x` and `y` based on their current values and their relationship with `w` and `z`, while `z` and `w` themselves evolve monotonically (`w` increments by 1 each iteration, `z` increments by 10 each iteration).

The post-condition to verify — `/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */` — suggests a relationship between `y` and `x` that is expected to hold after the loop finishes: if `y <= 2`, then `x` must be less than 4.

Intuitively, the loop manages `x` and `y` with conditions based on thresholds (e.g., `x >= 4`, `y > 10 * w`, `z >= 100 * x`) in a way that should ensure the post-condition remains valid after termination.

**Structure:**

- **Loop Condition:** The loop repeats `while(unknown())`. We do not know exactly when or how `unknown()` will return false, so we analyze inductively assuming any number of executions.

- **Variables:**
  - `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`: all initialized to 0 before the loop.
  - **Role of variables:**
    - `x` and `y`: main variables updated through different branches.
    - `w`: increments by 1 every iteration; acts as a step counter.
    - `z`: increments by 10 every iteration; a scaled step counter.

- **Body (per iteration):**
  
  - If `x >= 4`:
    - `x = x + 1;`
    - `y = y + 2;`
  
  - Else If `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`:
    - `y = 0 - y;` (negates `y`)
  
  - Else:
    - `x = x + 1;`
    - `y = y + 100;`
  
  - Independent of branches:
    - `w = w + 1;`
    - `z = z + 10;`

This branching structure creates distinct ways `x` and `y` grow or change each iteration depending on thresholds tied to `w` and `z`.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s track the evolution of variables for five iterations to detect patterns.

**Pre-Loop (initial) values:**

- `x = 0`
- `y = 0`
- `z = 0`
- `w = 0`

---

**Iteration 1 (first time in loop):**

- Condition checks:
  - `x >= 4`? No, `0 >= 4` false.
  - `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`? Check: `y=0 > 10*0=0`? False.
- Thus, else branch:
  - `x = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `y = 0 + 100 = 100`
- Update counters:
  - `w = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `z = 0 + 10 = 10`

**Values after iteration 1:**

- `x=1`, `y=100`, `z=10`, `w=1`

---

**Iteration 2:**

- Condition checks:
  - `x >= 4`? `1 >= 4` false.
  - `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`?
    - `100 > 10*1 = 10` TRUE
    - `10 >= 100*1 = 100` FALSE (10 >= 100? No)
  - Combined: false (second part false)
- Else branch:
  - `x = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `y = 100 + 100 = 200`
- Counters:
  - `w = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `z = 10 + 10 = 20`

**After iteration 2:**

`x=2, y=200, z=20, w=2`

---

**Iteration 3:**

- Condition checks:
  - `x >= 4`? `2 >= 4` false.
  - `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`?
    - `200 > 10*2=20` true
    - `20 >= 100*2=200` false
  - Else branch again:
    - `x=2+1=3`
    - `y=200+100=300`
  - Counters:
    - `w=2+1=3`
    - `z=20+10=30`

After iteration 3:

`x=3, y=300, z=30, w=3`

---

**Iteration 4:**

- Condition checks:
  - `x >= 4`? `3 >= 4` false.
  - `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`?
    - `300 > 10*3=30` true
    - `30 >= 100*3=300` false
  - Else branch again:
    - `x=3+1=4`
    - `y=300+100=400`
  - Counters:
    - `w=3+1=4`
    - `z=30+10=40`

After iteration 4:

`x=4, y=400, z=40, w=4`

---

**Iteration 5:**

- Condition checks:
  - `x >= 4`? `4 >= 4` true.
  - So first if branch:
    - `x=4+1=5`
    - `y=400+2=402`
  - Counters:
    - `w=4+1=5`
    - `z=40+10=50`

After iteration 5:

`x=5, y=402, z=50, w=5`

---

### Observations from samples:

- Initially, `x` increments and `y` jumps by 100 on each iteration because neither `x >= 4` nor the second condition hold.

- Once `x >= 4` becomes true (from iteration 5 onwards), `x` increments by 1 and `y` increments only by 2.

- The second branch (if `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`) never triggered in these first 5 iterations because `z` grows slower (by 10 per iter) than `100 * x`.

- `w` and `z` increase steadily as counters.

- `y` grows very quickly until `x >= 4`, then growth slows.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal:**

```c
/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */
```

This asserts that *if* at loop termination (or at assertion point) `y <= 2`, then `x < 4`.

---

**Can this be directly used as a loop invariant?**

- **NO.**

Why? Because:

1. At loop start, `y=0` and `x=0`, so `(y<=2)` is true, and `(x<4)` is true. So initial states satisfy the condition.

2. However, during loop iterations, `y` can become very large (like 100, 200, 300...) and `x` can be >=4 (observed sample: at iteration 5, `y=402` and `x=5`).

3. The implication `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is only meaningful when `y <= 2`. But `y` often exceeds 2 during the loop execution, making the antecedent false, thus implication trivially true. Therefore, it does not restrict the loop variables enough to serve as an invariant.

4. Moreover, the invariant must be true at every iteration’s start and end, but this assertion only constraints behavior at termination or post-loop.

---

**Can this verification goal be modified into a suitable invariant?**

Yes. Let's think carefully about expressing an invariant that links the growth of `y` and the value of `x` so that if `y` happens to be small (<= 2), then `x` should be smaller than 4.

Because the implication only demands a condition when `y <= 2`, let's propose the invariant in terms of ensuring that whenever `y` is small, `x` cannot be large.

Formally, a natural invariant candidate is:

```
(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)
```

But as confirmed, `y` generally grows large unless negated by the second branch, which we have not observed triggered yet.

Note the second branch negates `y` in some cases:

```c
else if(y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x) {
    y = 0 - y;
}
```

Could it be that the negation of `y` forces it to remain oscillated and sometimes be <= 2?

---

**Alternative invariant idea:**

Because the second branch flips the sign of `y` under some conditions, `y` can become negative and possibly kept bounded.

We might try:

- **Invariant candidate:**

    ```
    For all iterations: y ≤ 2 or y < 0 implies x < 4
    ```

But more simply, keep the original post-condition as invariant, plus a bound on `y` and `x` is needed to hold the post-condition at termination.

Alternatively, the loop invariant could be expressed as:

- "Either `x < 4` or `y > 2`."

Because the post-condition is `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`, its contrapositive is `(x >=4) ==> (y > 2)`.

**Therefore, an equivalent but more convenient invariant:**

```c
(x >= 4) ==> (y > 2)
```

This says: whenever `x` is at least 4, `y` must be greater than 2.

Is this invariant established initially and preserved by the loop?

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**

> At the start and end of every loop iteration, if `x` is greater than or equal to 4, then `y` must be strictly greater than 2.

**Formally:**

```c
(x >= 4) ==> (y > 2)
```

---

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Initially, `x=0`, so antecedent false, invariant trivially true.

- By samples, when `x` becomes 4 or more, the code path increments `y` by 2 or negates it if certain conditions hold.

- The increments of `y` in the `x >=4` branch increase `y` by 2 each iteration, keeping `y` > 2.

- When `x < 4`, the invariant imposes no constraint.

- The loop body logic prevents the combination `x >=4` and `y <= 2` from occurring simultaneously, which aligns with the post-condition.

---

### e. Establishment

- At loop start:

  - `x = 0` ⇒ `x >= 4` is false.
  
- Therefore, the invariant `(x >= 4) ==> (y > 2)` holds vacuously.

- Initial values satisfy the invariant without special assumptions.

---

### f. Preservation

Suppose invariant holds at the start of loop iteration `k`, and loop condition is true.

---

**Case 1: `x >= 4` at start of iteration**

- By the invariant: `y > 2` at start.

- Loop body execution:

  - First branch taken: `if (x >=4)`

    - `x` increases by 1; new `x` ≥ old `x` + 1 ≥ 5.

    - `y` increases by 2; new `y` > old `y` + 2 > 2 + 2 = 4. So still `y > 2`.

  - Counters `w` and `z` increase but don't affect invariant here.

- Hence, invariant preserved: new state satisfies `(x >=4) ⇒ (y > 2)` because `x` has increased, `y` increased beyond 2.

---

**Case 2: `x < 4` at start**

- The invariant requires nothing (antecedent false).

- Loop body may go to second or else branch.

- If else branch executed:
  
  - `x` increments by 1, so can become ≥4 in next iteration, but `y` increments by 100, thus likely `y > 2`.

- If second branch taken (negation of `y`):

  - `y` becomes `-y`.

  - Since invariant applies only when `x >=4` and at this point `x <4`, no contradiction.

- After iteration, either `x` remains < 4 or exceeds 4 with `y` large (due to increments of 100 or negations), ensuring the invariant holds at next iteration.

---

Thus, the invariant holds through all possible branch executions and variable updates.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- The loop exits when `unknown()` returns false.

- At that point, the invariant still holds.

- There are no assumptions on `unknown()`, so termination might happen at any iteration and thus any values.

- However, the invariant `(x >= 4) ⇒ (y > 2)` ensures the relation between `x` and `y` is maintained.

- From invariant and negation of loop condition, the program moves to the assertion:

  ```c
  (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)
  ```

- Using contrapositive: `(x >=4) ==> (y > 2)` is exactly the invariant.

- Since invariant holds at termination, assertion is guaranteed.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is **correct** given the loop logic and invariant.

- The invariant `(x >=4) ⇒ (y > 2)` is equivalent to the post-condition's contrapositive.

- **Proof:**

  - At loop termination:

    - Invariant holds: `(x >= 4) => (y > 2)`

    - Negation of loop condition holds (loop done).

  - Therefore, the assertion:

    - `(y <=2) => (x < 4)` must also hold, because if `(x >=4)` then `(y > 2)` by invariant, so if `y <= 2` then `(x >= 4)` cannot be true.

---

| a. Loop Purpose        | Loop manipulates `x, y, z, w`. `x` and `y` updated based on conditions involving `x, y, w, z`. Post-condition relates small `y` to small `x`.                             |
| b. Variable Sampling   | Initial zero values; `x` and `y` grow quickly, `w` and `z` steadily increment; second branch (negation of `y`) does not trigger in first 5 iterations.                      |
| c. Verification Goal   | Post-condition `(y <= 2) => (x < 4)` cannot be directly used as invariant; its contrapositive `(x >=4) => (y > 2)` used instead as invariant.                            |
| d. Loop Invariant      | `(x >=4) => (y > 2)` is proposed: holds initially, preserved, and implies post-condition at termination.                                                                |
| e. Establishment       | Holds at loop start since `x=0`, antecedent false, invariant trivially true.                                                                                            |
| f. Preservation        | Branch updates maintain invariant: if `x >=4`, `y` increases by 2; else invariant not challenged.                                                                        |
| g. Termination         | Loop exit preserves invariant. No matter when loop stops, invariant holds, supporting post-condition.                                                                   |

2025-12-23 01:01:49,675 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

    int x;

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop repeatedly updates four integer variables `(x, y, z, w)` based on conditions evaluated on `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The loop seems to manipulate `x` and `y` differently depending on threshold conditions involving `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z`. Each iteration increments `w` and `z` by fixed amounts.

The intended outcome appears exploratory or transformational, likely aiming to evolve values of `x` and `y` under a set of piecewise conditions, while accumulating increments in `w` and `z`.

**Loop Structure:**

- The governing condition is the unknown function:  
  `while(unknown())` — a non-deterministic, external Boolean condition controlling loop continuation.

- Loop body logic:

  1. If `x >= 4`:
     - `x` increases by 1.
     - `y` increases by 2.
  2. Else if `y > 10 * w` **and** `z >= 100 * x`:
     - `y` is negated (`y = 0 - y`).
  3. Else:
     - `x` increases by 1.
     - `y` increases by 100.

- After the conditional branches:
  - `w` increments by 1.
  - `z` increments by 10.

Relevant variables and their roles:

- `x`: evolves conditionally, sometimes incremented by 1; compared against threshold 4.
- `y`: updated variably depending on conditions, involves increments or negations.
- `z`: incremented unconditionally by 10 each iteration; compared to `100 * x`.
- `w`: incremented unconditionally by 1 each iteration; compared in relation with `y`.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Initial values before loop:
```
x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 0
```

We simulate possible executions up to 5 iterations. Since `unknown()` is non-deterministic, we consider typical scenarios.

**Iteration 1 (start: x=0,y=0,z=0,w=0):**

- `x = 0 < 4`, so first `if` false.
- `y > 10 * w`? → `0 > 10 * 0` → `0 > 0` → false.
- Else branch taken:
  - `x = x + 1 = 1`
  - `y = y + 100 = 100`
- After loop body:
  - `w = w + 1 = 1`
  - `z = z + 10 = 10`

**Variables after iter 1:**
```
x=1, y=100, z=10, w=1
```

---

**Iteration 2 (start: x=1,y=100,z=10,w=1):**

- `x = 1 < 4` → first `if` false.
- `y > 10 * w`? → `100 > 10 * 1` → `100 > 10` → true.
- `z >= 100 * x`? → `10 >= 100 *1` → `10 >= 100` → false
- Because `z >= 100 * x` is false, second condition false overall.
- Else branch taken:
  - `x = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `y = 100 + 100 = 200`
- `w = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `z = 10 + 10 = 20`

**Variables after iter 2:**
```
x=2, y=200, z=20, w=2
```

---

**Iteration 3 (start: x=2,y=200,z=20,w=2):**

- `x = 2 < 4` → first condition false.
- `y > 10 * w`? → `200 > 10 * 2` → `200 > 20` → true.
- `z >= 100 * x`? → `20 >= 100 * 2` → `20 >= 200` → false.
- Else branch taken:
  - `x = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `y = 200 + 100 = 300`
- `w = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `z = 20 + 10 = 30`

**Variables after iter 3:**
```
x=3, y=300, z=30, w=3
```

---

**Iteration 4 (start: x=3,y=300,z=30,w=3):**

- `x = 3 < 4` → first condition false.
- `y > 10 * w`? → `300 > 10 * 3` → `300 > 30` → true.
- `z >= 100 * x`? → `30 >= 100 * 3` → `30 >= 300` → false.
- Else branch taken:
  - `x = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `y = 300 + 100 = 400`
- `w = 3 + 1 = 4`
- `z = 30 + 10 = 40`

**Variables after iter 4:**
```
x=4, y=400, z=40, w=4
```

---

**Iteration 5 (start: x=4,y=400,z=40,w=4):**

- `x = 4 >= 4` → first condition true.
- Enter first branch:
  - `x = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - `y = 400 + 2 = 402`
- `w = 4 + 1 = 5`
- `z = 40 + 10 = 50`

**Variables after iter 5:**
```
x=5, y=402, z=50, w=5
```

---

*Note:* Because the condition `unknown()` is external, we cannot tell if loop terminates or continues beyond 5 iterations. So we analyze the state after 5 iterations as above.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Given assertion after the loop:**

```c
/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */
```

This states: 

- *If* `y <= 2`, *then* `x < 4`.

**Is the post-condition the verification goal?**  
Yes. The verification goal is to ensure that if at loop exit `y <= 2` holds, then `x < 4`.

**Can this verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- **NO**, it cannot serve as a loop invariant directly because:

  - At loop start, `y = 0`, which satisfies `y <= 2`, and `x = 0 < 4`, so it holds initially.

  - But during iterations, `y` can grow large (e.g., 100, 200, 300, ...), failing `y <= 2` during iterations, so the invariant condition `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` is trivially true **when `y > 2` because the implication is true if the premise is false**, but it does not provide interesting constraints during iteration.

  - More importantly, the loop body can make `x >= 4` and `y` very large, so the implication is trivially true because the premise is false most of the time.

  - At termination, the post-condition must hold. But it is not strong enough to characterize behavior during iterations.

**Can the verification goal be modified to create a valid invariant?**

Yes. To make it useful as an invariant, the condition should characterize the possible combinations of variables *during* iterations and *imply* the post-condition at termination.

For instance, the implication `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` can be reflected as a property limiting states where `y` is small relative to `x`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed loop invariant in natural language:

> *At the start and end of each iteration:*
> - If `y <= 2`, then `x < 4`.  (The original assertion)
> - `w` and `z` are non-negative and strictly increasing with iteration count:  
>   `w >= 0`, `z >= 0`
> - The variables `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z` evolve in such a way that `y` values larger than 2 imply no constraints on `x`.
> - The values `x` and `w` increase monotonically or remain consistent with the threshold behaviors observed.

### Explanation why this invariant is valid:

- **Invariant 1: `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`**

  - Initially holds: `y=0 <= 2` and `x=0 <4`.
  - In every iteration, if `y` becomes small again (e.g., resets to negative `y` via negation), then `x` must still be less than 4 to hold the implication.
  - The loop only allows `x >= 4` if `y` is large (`y` increments by at least 2 or 100), so `y` will almost never be small when `x >= 4`.
  - The condition is maintained because:
    - If `x >= 4`, the loop increments `x` and adds a small increment to `y` (by 2), so `y` does not come back to <= 2.
    - If `x < 4`, large increments to `y` can be negated depending on conditions, potentially making `y` smaller.

- **Safety of the invariant:**

  The implication is structurally valid as an invariant because it constrains only low values of `y`. When `y` is large, the implication is vacuously true.

---

## e. Establishment

- Before the loop starts:
  
  Variables are initialized as:
  ```
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0
  w = 0
  ```

- Check the invariant `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)`:

  - `y = 0 <= 2` is true, so the premise holds.
  - `x = 0 < 4` is true.
  
- Therefore, the invariant holds before the first iteration. Establishment is guaranteed by initial assignments.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume the invariant holds at the start of a loop iteration.

- Show that after executing the loop body, invariant still holds at loop end:

1. If `y <= 2` at start and `x < 4` at start (from invariant premise and conclusion)…

   - Consider the conditional branches:

     - If `x >= 4` branch is false (since `x < 4`), so it goes to else if or else.

2. Evaluate the second branch else if (`y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`):

   - If `y <= 2`, then `y > 10 * w` is very unlikely unless `w` is 0.

   - Negation of `y` might occur, flipping `y` negative, keeping `y` small or less than or equal to 2.

3. Else branch:

   - `x` increments by 1 (still possibly < 4 depending on previous value).

   - `y` increments by 100, so `y` becomes large, violating premise `y <= 2`, but then implication is trivially true.

4. After branches:

   - `w` and `z` increment, increasing thresholds used in conditions.

- Summary:

  - If `y <= 2` holds at start and `x < 4`, either `y` grows large (premise false, implication true), or `y` is negated or reset but `x` remains controlled so `x < 4` holds.

  - If `y <= 2` at end, then `x < 4` must still hold because otherwise the `x >= 4` branch would have incremented `y` by only 2 and the implication would fail.

- Hence, invariant is preserved by iteration logic.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- At loop termination (`unknown() == false`):

  Variables have some values `x_f, y_f, w_f, z_f`.

- The invariant `(y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)` remains valid by preservation.

- The assertion just after loop is the same implication and therefore guaranteed to hold.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Is the post-condition correct?**

  Yes. The assertion  
  ```c
  (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);
  ```  
  holds because during loop execution and termination, whenever `y` is small (`<= 2`), `x` is guaranteed to be less than 4.

- **How invariant and loop termination imply post-condition:**

  - The invariant is inductive: holds before loop, preserved by loop, and true after loop.

  - On loop exit, the invariant applies together with the negation of the loop condition (termination condition), directly implying the post-condition.

---

2025-12-23 01:19:46,440 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`
