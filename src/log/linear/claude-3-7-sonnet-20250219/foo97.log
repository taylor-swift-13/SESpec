### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**:  
  This loop increments `i` by 1 and `j` by `y` on each iteration, starting from zero. It runs while `i` is less than or equal to `x`. The intended effect seems to be correlating `i` and `j` in some way related to `y`. The loop accumulates counts in `i` and sums increments in `j`. The post-condition checks that if `y` equals 1, then `i` equals `j`.

- **Loop Structure**:  
  - *Governing condition*: `while (i <= x)` — loop continues as long as `i` is at most `x`.  
  - *Loop body*:
    - `i = i + 1;` (increments `i` by 1 each iteration)  
    - `j = j + y;` (increments `j` by `y` each iteration)
  - *Relevant variables*:
    - `i` (loop counter, starts at 0)
    - `j` (accumulated sum, starts at 0)
    - `y` (fixed increment value, initialized to 2 and not modified)
    - `x` (input parameter, upper bound for `i`)

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We start with initial values before the loop:

| Sample | i | j | y | Condition i <= x? |
|--------|---|---|---|--------------------|
| Pre-Loop | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 <= x (true) |

Now take post-iteration samples for up to 5 iterations:

- **Iteration 1 (after loop body executes once):**  
  i = 0 + 1 = 1  
  j = 0 + 2 = 2  
  condition check for next iteration: 1 <= x

| Iteration | i | j | y | Loop continues? |
|-----------|---|---|---|-----------------|
| 1         | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 <= x          |

- **Iteration 2:**  
  i = 1 + 1 = 2  
  j = 2 + 2 = 4  
  loop condition: 2 <= x

| 2         | 2 | 4 | 2 | true            |

- **Iteration 3:**  
  i = 2 + 1 = 3  
  j = 4 + 2 = 6  
  loop condition: 3 <= x

| 3         | 3 | 6 | 2 | true            |

- **Iteration 4:**  
  i = 3 + 1 = 4  
  j = 6 + 2 = 8  
  condition: 4 <= x

| 4         | 4 | 8 | 2 | true            |

- **Iteration 5:**  
  i = 4 + 1 = 5  
  j = 8 + 2 = 10  
  condition: 5 <= x

| 5         | 5 | 10 | 2 | true           |

Assuming `x >= 5`, the loop continues. If loop terminates earlier (when `i > x`), we take final sample:

- **Post-Loop (termination):**  
  Loop ends when `i > x`. At termination, `i = x + 1` (since the increment happens inside the loop), and `j` accumulates increments of `y` exactly `i` times (i.e., `x + 1` times).

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal / Post-Condition**:  
  ```c
  /*@ assert (y == 1) ==> (i == j); */
  ```
  This states: if `y` equals 1, then `i` equals `j`. In other words, when incrementing `j` by 1 at each loop iteration, `j` should track the number of iterations `i`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant directly?** 

  *No.* Because:  
  - The post-condition relates `i` and `j` via an equality only if `y == 1`.  
  - During the loop iterations, `j` is incremented by `y`, but here `y` is initialized to 2, so `(y == 1)` is false. Post-condition only applies if `y == 1`.  
  - Moreover, the invariant must hold at every iteration — equality `i == j` will not hold during iterations unless `y` is 1.

- **Can we modify the verification goal to a suitable invariant?**

  Yes. The key observation is that at each iteration:

  ```
  j = y * i
  ```

  Because:
  - Initially, `i = 0`, `j = 0`.
  - Each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
  - Each iteration, `j` increases by `y`.
  
  So after k iterations:

  ```
  i = k
  j = y * k
  ```

  Thus a *valid* invariant that holds during all iterations is:

  ```
  j == y * i
  ```

- **This invariant satisfies:**

  - Establishment (holds before loop starts).
  - Preservation (maintained every iteration).
  - Termination (when loop ends, combining invariant with loop exit conditions helps prove post-condition).

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

  *"At the start of each loop iteration (and end of each iteration), the variable `j` equals `y` multiplied by `i`."*

- **Explanation of validity:**

  - Before the loop begins, `i = 0` and `j = 0` → `j == y * i` holds trivially.
  - Each iteration increments `i` by 1 and `j` by `y`, so the relationship `j = y * i` is maintained exactly.
  - This invariant describes a linear relationship between `i` and `j` that is preserved by the loop’s update statements.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the first loop iteration:

  ```
  i = 0
  j = 0
  y = 2 (or any initial value)
  ```

- Check proposed invariant: `j == y * i` ⇒ `0 == y * 0` ⇒ `0 == 0` true.

- Since the pre-condition is effectively no restrictions on `i`, `j`, and with initialization given, the invariant holds before entering the loop.

---

### f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration: `j == y * i`.
- Loop condition: `i <= x` is true.

- Loop body updates:

  ```
  i = i + 1;
  j = j + y;
  ```

- After updates:

  ```
  new i = old i + 1
  new j = old j + y
  ```

- Using invariant at start of iteration:

  ```
  old j = y * old i
  ```

- Substitute:

  ```
  new j = y * old i + y = y * (old i + 1) = y * new i
  ```

- Therefore, the invariant `j == y * i` holds at the end of the iteration.

- Thus preservation is demonstrated.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `i <= x` is false ⇒ `i > x`.
- Since `i` increments by 1 each iteration starting from zero, termination occurs when:

  ```
  i == x + 1
  ```

- From the invariant at termination:

  ```
  j == y * i = y * (x + 1)
  ```

- The loop invariant `j == y * i` still holds.

- Because `i > x` at termination, the loop exit condition holds, and the invariant remains valid at loop exit.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- Post-condition:

  ```
  (y == 1) ==> (i == j)
  ```

- Using the loop invariant at termination `j == y * i`, if `y == 1` then:

  ```
  j == 1 * i
  j == i
  ```

- So if `y == 1`, at loop exit, `i == j` holds true.

- Thus, the invariant plus loop termination imply the post condition. The assertion is correct.

---

## **Summary of Formal Results**

- **Loop invariant:**

  ```
  j == y * i
  ```

- **Establishment:**

  At initialization: `i=0`, `j=0`, so `j == y * i` holds (0 == y * 0).

- **Preservation:**

  If held at iteration start, then after `i++`, `j+=y` updates, `j == y * i` still holds.

- **Termination:**

  After loop finishes, `i == x + 1`, so `j == y * (x + 1)`.

- **Post condition proof:**

  When `y == 1`, then from invariant:

  ```
  j == i
  ```

  proving the post condition `(y == 1) ==> (i == j)`.

2025-12-23 05:29:39,134 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(y == 2) * (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo97(int x) {
    int i =0;
    int j =0;
    int y =2;
