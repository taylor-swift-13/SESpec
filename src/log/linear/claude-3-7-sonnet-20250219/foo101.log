    int x = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
    /*@

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

  The loop is designed to increment the variable `x` starting from 0 until `x` reaches `n`. The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, `x` should be equal to `n` if `n` is non-negative. The loop essentially counts upwards from 0 to `n`.

- **Loop Structure:**

  - **Condition:** `while (x < n)`
    - The loop continues as long as `x` is strictly less than `n`.
  - **Loop Body Operation:** `x = x + 1;`
    - Each iteration increments `x` by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables:**
    - `int n`: the upper bound or target value.
    - `int x`: the loop counting variable, initialized to 0.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Iteration Stage              | `x` Value           | Notes                           |
|------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Pre-Loop                     | `x = 0`             | Initial value set before loop  |
| After Iteration 1            | `x = 1`             | Incremented once               |
| After Iteration 2            | `x = 2`             | Incremented twice             |
| After Iteration 3            | `x = 3`             | Incremented thrice            |
| After Iteration 4            | `x = 4`             | Incremented four times        |
| After Iteration 5            | `x = 5`             | Incremented five times        |

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: The loop terminates when `x` is no longer less than `n`. This means:
  
  - If `n > 0` and `n ≤ 5` in the above example, loop stops when `x = n`.
  
  - If `n ≤ 0`, the loop condition `x < n` is false at the start (`0 < n` false if `n ≤ 0`), loop never runs and `x` remains 0.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal / Post-condition:**

  ```
  (x != n) ==> (n < 0);
  ```

  This states: if after the loop `x` is not equal to `n`, then `n` must be negative.

- **Can this goal be part of the loop invariant?**

  No, the verification goal itself is not suitable as a loop invariant because:

  - The invariant must hold *before* the loop begins and *after every iteration*.
  - Here, the verification goal only becomes relevant *after* the loop terminates.
  - During the loop, `x` generally will not equal `n` until termination, so `(x != n)` is true many times inside the loop, but `(n < 0)` may not be true then.
  - Therefore, this post-condition is about the relationship between `x` and `n` at termination, not in every iteration.

- **Can it be modified to create a valid invariant?**

  Yes. The key is to capture and maintain the fact that:

  ```
  0 <= x <= n  when n >= 0
  ```

  and if `n < 0` then the loop condition is false from the start and `x` remains 0.

  So, a better invariant that holds throughout the loop is:

  ```
  0 <= x <= n  OR  (n < 0 AND x == 0)
  ```

  This invariant states:

  - While the loop runs for non-negative `n`, `x` increments and remains between 0 and `n`.
  - For negative `n`, the loop never starts and `x` remains zero.

  At termination when `(x < n)` is false:

  - If `n >= 0`, then `x == n`.
  - If `n < 0`, loop does not run and `x == 0 != n`, matching the post-condition.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

  > At the start and end of every iteration of the loop, the variable `x` is a non-negative integer not greater than `n` if `n` is non-negative; if `n` is negative, then `x` has not changed from zero.

- **Detailed Explanation:**

  - Initially, `x = 0`.
  - If `n >= 0`, then `0 <= x <= n` initially holds, and each increment keeps `x` within this bound.
  - If `n < 0`, the loop never runs (since `0 < n` is false), so `x` remains 0.
  - This condition covers all states during loop execution and at termination.

---

### e. Establishment

- **How the invariant is established:**

  Before the loop starts:

  - `x = 0`
  - Therefore:
    - If `n >= 0`, then `0 <= 0 <= n` trivially true.
    - If `n < 0`, loop condition fails immediately, so invariant holds with `x = 0` and `n < 0`.
  
  Hence, the invariant holds before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

- **How invariant is preserved:**

  Assume at the start of an iteration:

  ```
  (n >= 0 && 0 <= x <= n)  OR  (n < 0 && x == 0)
  ```

  and assume the loop condition `x < n` is true.

- If `n < 0`:
  
  - Loop condition `x < n` cannot be true since `0 < n` false for negative `n`.
  
  - So this case never enters the loop, invariant trivially preserved.

- If `n >= 0`:

  - `x < n` means `x <= n - 1`.
  - Loop body does: `x = x + 1`.
  - After increment:
  
    ```
    x_new = x + 1 <= n
    ```
  
  - Since `x` was ≤ `n - 1`, `x_new` ≤ `n`, so invariant `0 ≤ x_new ≤ n` still holds.
  
- Thus, if the invariant holds at loop start and condition `x < n` is true, it holds after the iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- **When loop terminates:**

  Loop exits when condition `x < n` is false.

  Thus:

  - `x >= n`
  
  Given invariant constraints:

  - If `n >= 0`, `x ≤ n` and at termination `x ≥ n` imply:
  
    ```
    x == n
    ```
  
  - If `n < 0`, loop does not run, `x == 0`.

- **Invariant validity under termination:**

  The invariant holds on termination:

  - For `n >= 0`, `0 ≤ x = n ≤ n` true.
  - For `n < 0`, `x = 0` unchanged as loop does not run.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition:**

  ```
  (x != n) ==> (n < 0);
  ```

- **Is this correct?**

  Yes.

- **Explanation:**

  - When loop terminates, either:

    - `x == n`: the normal counting scenario for `n >= 0`.
    - Or `x != n`: this only happens if loop never ran, which requires `n < 0`.
    
  - The invariant ensures that for non-negative `n`, `x == n` at termination.
  
  Therefore:

  - If `x != n` after loop, `n` must be negative — the postcondition follows directly.

- **How invariant + negation of loop condition prove it:**

  From the invariant:

  - If `n >= 0`, at termination `x == n`.

  Loop terminates when `x < n` is false → `x >= n`.

  Combining:

  ```
  n >= 0  and  x >= n  and  x ≤ n  => x == n.
  ```

  So if `x != n`, it must be that `n < 0`.

---

## **Final Summary**

---

### Loop Invariant (formal style):

```c
/*@
  requires true;
  loop_invariant
    ( (n >= 0 && 0 <= x && x <= n) || (n < 0 && x == 0) );
  decreases n - x; // Optional termination metric if needed
@*/
```

| Loop Invariant          | `0 <= x <= n` if `n >= 0`, else `x == 0`                           |
| Establishment           | Holds at start because `x = 0` ≤ `n` or `n < 0`                    |
| Preservation            | Increment preserves bounds, no change if `n < 0`                    |
| Termination Condition   | Loop exits when `x >= n` → combined with invariant implies `x == n` |
| Post-condition Validity | Correct, follows from invariant + termination                       |

2025-12-22 22:17:27,828 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo101(int n) {
  
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL);
          loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;
          loop invariant (!(0 < \at(n,Pre))) ==> ((x == 0)&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (x < n) {
      
      x  = (x + 1);
      
    }
