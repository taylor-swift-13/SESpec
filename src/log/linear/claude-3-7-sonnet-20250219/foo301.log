## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop repeatedly increments the variable `i` by either 3 or 6 on each iteration, depending on the nondeterministic `unknown()` boolean function. The goal appears to be to advance `i` until it is no longer less than `n`. After the loop ends, it asserts that `i` is divisible by 3 (`i % 3 == 0`). Thus, the loop’s purpose is to reach or exceed `n` using increments of 3 or 6, maintaining that `i` remains a multiple of 3 throughout.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Loop Condition:** The `while(i < n)` loop continues as long as the integer `i` is less than `n`.
- **Loop Body:** Inside the loop:
  - It nondeterministically chooses between adding 6 or adding 3 to `i`.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `i`: loop counter, initialized to 0 and incremented by 3 or 6.
  - `n`: upper threshold controlling loop exit.
  - `unknown()`: arbitrary boolean function dictating whether to add 3 or 6.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

### Initial state (before loop):

- `i = 0`
- `n` is input, with `n <= 50,000,001`
- `j = 0` but is unused in loop body and thus irrelevant

### Iteration samples:

Because `unknown()` is nondeterministic, the increments can vary. Let's analyze **possible values** of `i` after each iteration, considering both increments:

| Iteration | Possible values of `i` after increment                          | Notes                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0 (start)| 0                                                               | Pre-loop initialization       |
| 1         | 0 + 3 = 3 OR 0 + 6 = 6                                         | `i` ∈ {3, 6}                  |
| 2         | From 3: 3+3=6 or 3+6=9; From 6: 6+3=9 or 6+6=12                | `i` ∈ {6, 9, 12}              |
| 3         | From 6: 6+3=9 or 6+6=12; From 9: 9+3=12 or 9+6=15; From 12: 12+3=15 or 12+6=18 | `i` ∈ {9,12,15,18}            |
| 4         | Continuing similarly by adding 3 or 6 to all previous values: 12,15,18,21,24 | `i` ∈ multiples of 3          |
| 5         | Similar pattern, all values remain multiples of 3                |                               |

**Note:** Every increment is either +3 or +6, both multiples of 3, so `i` remains a multiple of 3 at every iteration.

### Post-loop sampling (general):

When the loop terminates, the condition `i < n` is false, hence `i >= n`.

- Since `i` is always a multiple of 3 by design,
- After termination, `i % 3 == 0` holds.
- The final value of `i` will be the smallest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `n` reachable by increments of 3 or 6.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

```c
//@ assert i % 3 == 0;
```

We want to verify that after the loop terminates, `i` is divisible by 3.

**Can the goal be part of the loop invariant?**

- YES. Because at **every point** in the loop—including before starting, during, and after each iteration—`i` remains a multiple of 3.
- This happens because `i` starts at 0 (which is divisible by 3), and each increment is either +3 or +6, both divisible by 3.
- Therefore, `i % 3 == 0` does not only hold at loop termination but also holds at **the start and end of each iteration**.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):

> "At the beginning and end of every loop iteration, the variable `i` is a non-negative multiple of 3, and `i` does not exceed `n + 6`."

More formally:

```c
/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i <= n + 6 && i % 3 == 0; */
```

### Explanation:

- `i` starts at 0, which satisfies `i % 3 == 0` and `i <= n + 6` trivially (since `n` is non-negative and bounded by the pre-condition).
- Each iteration adds either 3 or 6, preserving the divisibility by 3.
- We add the upper bound `i <= n + 6` because the last increment could overshoot `n` by at most 6.
- This invariant ensures that `i` remains a multiple of 3 and within a valid range throughout.

---

## e. Establishment

- Before the first loop iteration, `i = 0`.
- `0` is divisible by 3, so `i % 3 == 0` holds initially.
- Also, since `n` is non-negative (implied by unsigned usage or logical context), `i = 0 <= n + 6` holds.
- Hence, the proposed invariant holds before entering the loop.

---

## f. Preservation

Assuming the invariant holds at the start of the iteration (`i % 3 == 0` and `0 <= i <= n + 6`), and the loop condition `i < n` is true:

- The loop increments `i` by either 3 or 6.
- Since `i` was divisible by 3, adding 3 or 6 keeps `i` divisible by 3.
- The new value of `i` becomes `i + 3` or `i + 6`. Since `i <= n + 6`, `i + 6 <= n + 12`.
- This means the new `i` might overshoot `n` by up to 12, which is slightly beyond the previous bound, so the exact upper bound requires slight refinement.

A tighter upper bound considering increments is:

- Because the loop condition is `i < n`, at loop start `i < n`.
- After increment, `i_new` = `i + (3 or 6)`.
- Minimum overshoot after last increment: `i_new - n <= 6`.

Therefore, in preservation, the invariant on the upper bound can be:

```c
0 <= i <= n + 6
```

holds throughout.

Thus, the invariant is preserved after every loop iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

Loop terminates when:

- `i < n` is false → `i >= n`.

At termination,

- `i` is still divisible by 3 (invariant holds).
- `i` may be equal to `n` or a multiple of 3 larger than `n`.
- Since the loop increments in steps of multiples of 3, `i` ≥ `n` but always divisible by 3.

The invariant `i % 3 == 0` still holds.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**

```c
//@ assert i % 3 == 0;
```

- The invariant guarantees this is true at the end of every iteration.
- At termination, the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition (`i >= n`) means `i % 3 == 0` and `i >= n`.
- Thus, the post-condition is correct.

---

# **Summary: Full Proposed Loop Invariant and Formal Annotation**

```c
/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i && i <= n + 6 && i % 3 == 0; */
while (i < n) {
   if (unknown())
     i = i + 6;
   else
     i = i + 3;
}
```

This invariant:

- Holds initially (establishment) since `i = 0` and `0 % 3 == 0`.
- Is preserved after each iteration because increments (+3 or +6) maintain divisibility and reasonable upper bound.
- At termination, since `i >= n` and `i % 3 == 0`, the post-condition is guaranteed.

---

# Overall Conclusion:

- The loop invariant `i % 3 == 0` is central and holds throughout.
- Adding range bounds on `i` clarifies the variable's state during and after the loop.
- The given post-condition asserting divisibility by 3 is correct and follows naturally from the loop invariant and termination conditions.

- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) <= 50000001 && (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires n <= 50000001;
    */
    
void foo301(int n) {

    int i;
    int j;

    i = 0;
    j = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

          loop invariant j == 0;
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;

2025-12-22 21:50:45,788 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) <= 50000001 && (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`
