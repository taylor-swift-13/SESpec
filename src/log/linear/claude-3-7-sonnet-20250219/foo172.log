## Code under consideration

```c
/*@ requires n > 0; */
void foo172(int n) {

    int i;
    int sum;

    sum = 0;
    i = 0;

    /*@

}
```

# a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Loop Purpose:**

The loop’s intent is to compute the sum of all integers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. In other words, it calculates:

\[
\text{sum} = 0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1)
\]

The variable `sum` accumulates these values, and `i` serves as the loop counter indexing from 0 to \(n-1\).

**Loop Structure:**

- **Governing Condition:** `while(i < n)`

  The loop continues while `i` is less than `n`.

- **Loop Body Operations:**
  - Adds the current value of `i` to `sum`.
  - Increments `i` by 1.

- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `i`: the loop counter, starting at 0 and incremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `sum`: accumulator initialized to 0 and updated in each iteration.

---

# b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop (Before first iteration):**

  ```
  i = 0
  sum = 0
  ```

- **After iteration 1 (i=0 processed):**

  ```
  sum = 0 + 0 = 0
  i = 1
  ```

- **After iteration 2 (i=1 processed):**

  ```
  sum = 0 + 1 = 1
  i = 2
  ```

- **After iteration 3 (i=2 processed):**

  ```
  sum = 1 + 2 = 3
  i = 3
  ```

- **After iteration 4 (i=3 processed):**

  ```
  sum = 3 + 3 = 6
  i = 4
  ```

- **After iteration 5 (i=4 processed):**

  ```
  sum = 6 + 4 = 10
  i = 5
  ```

*(Assuming n ≥ 5 for full five iterations.)*

- **Post-Loop Sampling (when loop terminates):**

  Loop stops when `i >= n`.

  At termination:

  ```
  i == n
  sum = 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) = n*(n-1)/2
  ```

--- 

# c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

  ```
  (i >= n) ==> (sum >= 0)
  ```

This states: *If the loop counter `i` has reached or passed `n` (loop exited), then `sum` is at least 0.*

- **Can this be part of the invariant?**

  No, **not directly.**

  - The post-condition is trivially true because sum is the sum of natural numbers starting at 0, so it will be non-negative on termination.
  
  - However, during the loop execution, `i` is incremented gradually and loop may or may not have this condition true. Also, `i >= n` is false inside the loop, so it cannot be part of the invariant, which must hold at the beginning of **every iteration**, including when `i < n`.

- **Can it be modified to create a suitable invariant?**

  The condition `sum >= 0` is always true (since 0 and positive integers accumulate).

  A valid invariant would express a more precise relationship between `sum` and `i`.

- **Proposal for modified invariant based on sum and i:**

  ```
  sum == 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (i-1)
  ```

In formal terms:

\[
sum = \frac{i(i-1)}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq i \leq n
\]

This invariant:

- Holds before loop starts (`i=0, sum=0`)
- Maintained each iteration as `sum` accumulates the previous `i`.
- At termination (`i == n`), implies the post-condition `sum >= 0`.

---

# d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

> At the start of each iteration, `sum` equals the sum of all integers from 0 up to `i - 1` (i.e., all values processed so far), and `i` is between 0 and `n`.

**Expressed formally:**

\[
0 \leq i \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad sum = \frac{i(i-1)}{2}
\]

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Initially `i=0` and `sum=0`, so invariant holds because sum of zero terms is 0.
- At each iteration, `sum` is updated by adding the current `i`, and `i` increments by 1.
- This maintains the correctness of the relationship between `sum` and `i`.
- Since `i` increases by 1 each iteration, it will eventually reach `n`.
- The upper bound `i <= n` ensures the loop does not run infinitely.
- Thus, the invariant captures the progress and correctness of `sum` and `i` throughout the loop.

---

# e. Establishment

- **How is the invariant established initially?**

Before the loop starts:

- `i` is set to 0
- `sum` is set to 0

Check if invariant holds:

\[
0 \leq 0 \leq n \quad \text{(true since } n > 0 \text{)} 
\]

\[
sum = 0 = \frac{0 \times (0-1)}{2} = 0
\]

Therefore, the invariant holds before the first loop iteration.

- The precondition `n > 0` ensures the upper bound is valid and the loop condition has meaning.

---

# f. Preservation

- **Assume invariant holds at iteration start:**

\[
0 \leq i < n, \quad sum = \frac{i (i - 1)}{2}
\]

- **Loop body updates:**

```
sum = sum + i;
i = i + 1;
```

- **Goal: invariant holds at iteration end (for next iteration) with `i` incremented:**

We want to check:

\[
sum_{\text{new}} = \frac{i_{\text{new}} (i_{\text{new}} - 1)}{2}
\]

where

\[
i_{\text{new}} = i + 1
\]

\[
sum_{\text{new}} = sum + i
\]

Substitute `sum`:

\[
sum_{\text{new}} = \frac{i(i-1)}{2} + i = \frac{i(i-1) + 2i}{2} = \frac{i(i+1)}{2}
\]

Check if this equals the formula for `i_new`:

\[
\frac{(i+1)(i+1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{(i+1) i}{2}
\]

They match, so:

\[
sum_{\text{new}} = \frac{i_{\text{new}}(i_{\text{new}} - 1)}{2}
\]

The bounds on `i` are preserved because starting from \(i < n\), after increment, \(i_{\text{new}} = i + 1 \leq n\).

Therefore, the invariant is maintained through iteration.

---

# g. Termination Analysis

- **Loop terminates when:**

\[
i \geq n
\]

Given the invariant holds at every loop start, at termination:

- \(i = n\)
- \(sum = \frac{n (n - 1)}{2}\)

The invariant remains valid under the termination condition because \(i\) is within allowed bounds and sum is as expected.

---

# h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Provided post-condition:**

```
(i >= n) ==> (sum >= 0)
```

- **Is it correct?**

Yes, because:

- \(i\) reaching \(n\) means loop is done.
- \(sum\) accumulates \(0 + 1 + ... + (n-1)\), which is a sum of non-negative integers, so it is always \(\geq 0\).

- **How does invariant plus negation of loop condition prove it?**

At termination,

- Invariant: \(sum = \frac{i(i-1)}{2}\)
- Negation of loop condition: \(i \geq n\)

Since \(i\) can only be \(n\) or larger (loop stops at exactly \(i = n\)),

- \(sum = \frac{n (n-1)}{2} \geq 0\) (as \(n > 0\))

Thus, the post-condition trivially holds.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **a. Purpose & Structure**  | Loop sums integers 0 to \(n-1\). Uses `i` loop counter (0 to \(n-1\)), increments sum by i at each step.                  |

| **d. Loop Invariant**       | `0 <= i <= n` and `sum = (i*(i-1))/2`; means sum is total of numbers 0..(i-1) at each iteration start.                     |

| **f. Preservation**         | Adding current i to sum and incrementing i fits summation formula, invariant preserved each loop iteration.                |
| **g. Termination**          | Loop stops when i = n; invariant holds and sum = sum of 0..(n-1), matching the formula.                                   |
| **h. Post-condition**       | Correct, sum is non-negative as it's sum of non-negative integers; invariant + loop exit imply post-condition.           |

2025-12-23 01:26:44,908 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (sum == 0) * (i == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires n > 0;

    int sum;

    sum = 0;

2025-12-23 01:26:59,146 - DEBUG  -  Looking at the loop analysis and the requirements, I need to fill in the placeholders with appropriate loop invariants.

From the analysis:
- The loop invariant should express: `0 <= i <= n` and `sum == (i * (i - 1)) / 2`
- The loop modifies variables `i` and `sum`

Given the template structure with conditional invariants based on the precondition, here's the complete code:

```c
