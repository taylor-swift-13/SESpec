## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose of the loop:**

- This loop repeatedly executes as long as the function `unknown()` returns true.
- Inside the loop, based on a nested `unknown()` condition, the integer variable `c` is updated either by incrementing it (if `c != n`) or setting it to 1 if it matches `n`.
- The variable `c` appears to count upwards but is reset to 1 under certain conditions when `c == n`.
- The goal seems to be maintaining some counter `c` that is bounded by `n` while the loop executes.

**Loop structure:**

- **Condition:** `while(unknown())` — the loop runs as long as some external/unknown condition is true.
- **Body:** 
  - Reads two unknown booleans (`unknown()`)—one for the loop condition, one for the inner if-else.
  - If the inner condition is true:
    - If `c != n`, increment `c`.
    - Otherwise, do nothing.
  - If the inner condition is false:
    - If `c == n`, set `c = 1`.
    - Otherwise, do nothing.
- **Variables:**
  - `int c`: the main variable modified in the loop, initialized to 0.
  - `int n`: input parameter, required by a precondition to be strictly positive (`n > 0`).

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Since `unknown()` is nondeterministic, we can only speculate possible value progressions of `c` for some example scenarios. Let’s sample plausible `c` values over five iterations assuming arbitrary `unknown()` return values.

**Pre-loop:**

- `c = 0`

**Iteration 1:**

- Case 1 inner = true, `c != n` since `c=0`, increment:
- `c = 1`

**Iteration 2:**

- Case 1 inner = true, `c=1`, if `c != n` (assuming `n>1`):
- `c = 2`

**Iteration 3:**

- Case 1 inner = false, inner else branch; 
- if `c == n`? Say not yet, no change:
- `c = 2`

**Iteration 4:**

- Case 1 inner = true, still `c != n` (assuming `n > 2`)
- increment `c = 3`

**Iteration 5:**

- Case 1 inner = false
- If `c == n`?
  - Assume `c` reached `n` (say `n=3`), then reset:
  - `c=1`

These are representative transitions, but many other paths exist due to `unknown()`.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert  (c != n ) ==> (c <= n); */
```

Meaning: if `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` is at most `n`.

**Can it serve as the loop invariant?**

- The goal is about a relationship between `c` and `n` that must hold after the loop.
- **NO**, as stated, it cannot be the sole invariant because:
  - It involves an implication,
  - `c != n` can vary during loop iterations,
  - And it only specifies an upper bound condition loosely — no guarantee it holds all along the loop for each iteration ignoring cases where `c == n`.

**Modify for invariant:**

- We want an invariant that bounds `c` to be between 0 and `n`, or somewhere close.
- A better invariant candidate would be:

  ```
  0 <= c <= n
  ```

- This stronger invariant says `c` never falls outside the valid bounds, including the possibility `c == n`.
- This invariant is:

  - **Established** initially since `c=0` and `n > 0`.
  - **Preserved** by the increments (`c+1` only if `c != n`) and resets (to 1 if `c == n`) which keep `c` within `[0,n]`.
  - At termination, combined with loop condition false, implies the postcondition.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (in natural language):**

- "`c` is an integer such that `0 <= c <= n` throughout every iteration of the loop."

**Why is it valid?**

- Initially, `c = 0` and since `n > 0`, clearly `0 <= c <= n`.
- The body either increments `c` by 1 only if `c < n` (because if `c == n`, it does not increment), or resets `c` to 1 if `c == n`. Both keep `c` within `[1,n]` — hence `c` never overflows beyond `n`.
- It never becomes negative because only increments or assignments to positive integers occur.
- This invariant bounds `c` properly, encompassing all modifications visible in the loop body.

---

## e. Establishment

- At the start, `c` is initialized to 0.
- The precondition states that input parameter `n > 0`.
- Thus, before the first loop iteration, `0 <= c = 0 <= n` is true.
- Therefore, the invariant `0 <= c <= n` holds just prior to entering the loop.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume before an iteration, `0 <= c <= n`.
- The loop body modifies `c` only in these ways:
  1. If the condition `unknown()` is true, and `c != n`, `c` increments by 1.
     - Since `c < n`, increment keeps `c` within `[1,n]`.
  2. If the condition `unknown()` is false, and if `c == n`, `c` is reset to 1.
     - 1 is within `[1,n]`.
  3. In all other cases, `c` remains unchanged.
- No operation can push `c` outside `[0,n]`.
- Therefore, if the invariant holds at the start of the iteration, it holds at the end.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.
- At termination, the invariant `0 <= c <= n` still holds.
- We must consider the postcondition:

  ```c
  (c != n) ==> (c <= n)
  ```

- Since `c` is between 0 and n, the condition `c != n` means `c < n` or `c > n` (which can't happen), so it implies `c <= n` trivially holds.
- The invariant holds under the termination condition.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition: 

  ```
  (c != n) ==> (c <= n)
  ```

- **Is it correct?** Yes, it is logically sound given the invariant.
- Because:
  - At termination, `c` is within `[0,n]`.
  - If `c != n`, then `c < n` (since `c > n` is impossible from the invariant).
  - Hence, `c <= n` is always true.
- Thus, the combination of the loop invariant (`0 <= c <= n`) and the negation of the loop condition implies the post-condition.

---

# **Summary**

**Loop Invariant (formal style):**

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;
*/
```

**Why valid:**

- Established before loop (c=0, n>0).
- Preserved by loop body (increments and resets keep c within [0,n]).
- At termination, combined with loop condition false, proves post-condition.

**Post-condition correctness:**

- The assertion `(c != n) ==> (c <= n)` logically follows from `0 <= c <= n` at loop exit.

---

If you want, I can also help express the invariant as formal ACSL annotation for integration into the code. Let me know!

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.

2025-12-22 21:48:10,287 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
