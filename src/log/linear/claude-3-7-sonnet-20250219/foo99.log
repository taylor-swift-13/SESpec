## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and intended outcome:**  
The loop's purpose is to count down the variable `x` from its initial value `n` to 0, while simultaneously incrementing `y` to track how many times the loop has run. At termination, the sum of `x` and `y` should equal the original input `n`. In other words, `y` accumulates how many decrements have been taken from `x`.

**Loop structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while (x > 0)` — The loop runs as long as `x` is positive.
- **Loop body operations:**
  - `y = y + 1;` — increment `y` by one each iteration.
  - `x = x - 1;` — decrement `x` by one each iteration.
- **Relevant variables:** 
  - `x`: starts at `n` and counts down to 0.
  - `y`: starts at 0 and counts up during loop iterations.
  - `n`: input parameter, constant throughout the function (no reassignment).
  
Thus, the loop effectively transfers the initial value stored in `x` to `y` via a repeated decrement/increment cycle.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We track the values of `x` and `y` over the first 5 iterations. Assume an arbitrary input `n >= 5` for concreteness.

| Stage                       | x    | y    | Comment                   |
|-----------------------------|------|------|---------------------------|
| **Pre-loop (initial)**        | n    | 0    | Loop not started yet      |
| After iteration 1 (post-loop) | n-1  | 1    | x decreased, y incremented|
| After iteration 2            | n-2  | 2    |                           |
| After iteration 3            | n-3  | 3    |                           |
| After iteration 4            | n-4  | 4    |                           |
| After iteration 5            | n-5  | 5    |                           |

- If `n <= 5`, loop terminates whichever iteration `x` hits zero or negative. In this case, a post-loop sample is taken right after the final iteration.

- If the loop terminates after `k` iterations, then at termination:

  ```
  x = n - k
  y = k
  ```
  
  and `x <= 0` (loop condition false).

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert n == x + y; */
```

We want to prove that after the loop terminates, the sum of `x` and `y` equals the original input `n`.

**Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

- *No.* The assertion states `n == x + y` must hold at the end of the loop. However, inside the loop:

  - Initially `x = n`, `y = 0`, so `n == x + y` holds before the loop begins.
  
  - After the first iteration, `x = n - 1` and `y = 1`, sum is still `n`.
  
  So the equation actually holds before and after each iteration.

This suggests the verification goal **can** also be a loop invariant candidate because it holds before the loop starts (establishment), is preserved by each iteration, and at termination it clearly implies the post-condition.

Thus:

- YES: The verification goal *can* be used as part of the loop invariant because it remains true at all points — before, during, and after the loop.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**  
At the start and end of every iteration of the loop, the sum of `x` and `y` equals the initial value `n` passed into the function.

Formally:  
`n == x + y`

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Before the loop, `x = n` and `y = 0`, so the sum is `n`.
- Each iteration simultaneously decreases `x` by 1 and increases `y` by 1, maintaining the sum.
- Therefore, the sum `x + y` is always equal to the initial `n` throughout the loop's execution.

---

## e. Establishment

**How it is established:**

- Before the first loop iteration, from these initializations:

  ```
  x = n;
  y = 0;
  ```
  
  We have:

  ```
  x + y = n + 0 = n
  ```
  
- Thus, the proposed invariant `n == x + y` holds before the loop begins.

---

## f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved:**

Suppose at the start of an arbitrary iteration `i`, the invariant holds:

```
n == x + y
```

and the loop condition `x > 0` is true, allowing the iteration to proceed.

Inside the loop:

```
y = y + 1;
x = x - 1;
```

At the end of the iteration:

```
new_x = x - 1;
new_y = y + 1;
```

Sum:

```
new_x + new_y = (x - 1) + (y + 1) = x + y = n
```

Because the sum remains unchanged, the invariant `n == x + y` holds at the end of the iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**State when loop terminates:**

- Loop terminates when the guard `x > 0` becomes false, i.e.:

  ```
  x <= 0
  ```

- At this point, the invariant `n == x + y` still holds.

- Since `x <= 0`, the value of `x` could be zero or negative (if `x` was exactly 1 before the iteration, after decrement it becomes 0; but since the condition was checked before decrement, the loop body always decrements x once it is positive).

- Commonly, `x == 0` at termination is expected.

**Invariant validity at termination:**

- The invariant `n == x + y` holds regardless. Since `x` is zero or less, `y` must have accumulated the value close to or equal to `n`.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Is the post-condition correct?**

- The post-condition:

  ```
  n == x + y
  ```

  must hold after loop termination.

- Because the invariant holds during the entire loop and the loop terminates when `x <= 0`, the sum relation still holds.

- Specifically, at termination, `x` can only be zero or less; since the loop only terminates when `x > 0` is false, `x` is zero exactly if no extra decrements occurred outside the loop.

- Thus, the post-condition is correct.

**How does the invariant prove the post-condition?**

- At loop exit, the invariant `n == x + y` holds.

- Negation of loop condition is `x <= 0`.

- Combining:

  ```
  n == x + y
  and
  x <= 0
  ```

- Since `x` cannot be negative beyond the decrement steps in the loop, `y` holds the count of decrements performed.

- This fulfills the post-condition as it asserts `y` accounts exactly for the difference `n - x`.

| Aspect                     | Explanation                                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Invariant candidate**     | `n == x + y`                                     |
| **Establishment**           | Initialized to true before loop (`x = n, y = 0`)|
| **Preservation**            | Each iteration increments `y` and decrements `x` equally, preserving sum |
| **Termination**             | Loop exits when `x <= 0`, invariant still true  |
| **Post-condition correctness** | Post-condition is the invariant and correctly expresses the initial value decomposition |

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(y == 0) * (x == \at(n,Pre)) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo99(int n) {

    int x = n;
    int y = 0;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL);
          loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;
          loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_y) ;
          loop invariant (!(\at(n,Pre) > 0)) ==> ((y == 0)&&(x == \at(n,Pre))&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (x > 0) {
      
      y  = y + 1;
      x  = x - 1;
  
    }
            
  
    /*@ assert n == x + y; */
  
  }`
