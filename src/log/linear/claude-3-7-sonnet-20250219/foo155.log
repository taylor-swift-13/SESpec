## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose & Intended Outcome:**

- The loop iteratively updates variables `j` and `k` based on the value of `t`.
- `t` acts as a flag to determine which update path to follow.
- If `t == 0`, the loop increments `j` by 4.
- If `t != 0`, the loop increments `j` by 2 and `k` by 1.
- After the loop terminates, the assertion checks that if `k` is nonzero then:
  1. `t` must be nonzero (meaning the else branch executed at least once),
  2. `j == k * 2 + 2`.

Essentially, this means the loop accumulates values into `j` and `k`, related by the formula `j = 2 + 2*k` when the `else` branch executes (i.e., when `t != 0`).

**Loop Structure:**

- **Condition:** The loop continues while `unknown()` returns true (nonzero).
- **Variables involved:** `j` and `k` are updated in the loop; `t` is read but never assigned inside the loop.
- **Body:**
  - If `t == 0`: increment `j` by 4.
  - Else: increment `j` by 2 and increment `k` by 1.

Note that `t` is never modified within the function or the loop, so it is effectively a constant during the loop (but unknown beforehand).

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- Initial values before loop:
  - `j = 2`
  - `k = 0`
  - `t = unknown` (unknown value, but constant throughout the loop)

We assume for sampling that the loop condition (`unknown()`) is true (at least for the first 5 iterations).

---

**When `t == 0`:**

| Iteration | j before | k before | Branch  | j after     | k after |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 0 (start)| 2         | 0        | -       | 2           | 0       |
| 1         | 2         | 0        | `t==0`  | 2 + 4 = 6   | 0       |
| 2         | 6         | 0        | `t==0`  | 6 + 4 = 10  | 0       |
| 3         | 10        | 0        | `t==0`  | 10 + 4 = 14 | 0       |
| 4         | 14        | 0        | `t==0`  | 14 + 4 = 18 | 0       |
| 5         | 18        | 0        | `t==0`  | 18 + 4 = 22 | 0       |

Since `k` does not change (`k=0`), the assertion `(k != 0) ==> ...` is vacuously true.

---

**When `t != 0`:**

| Iteration | j before | k before | Branch   | j after         | k after   |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0 (start)| 2         | 0        | -        | 2               | 0         |
| 1         | 2         | 0        | else     | 2 + 2 = 4       | 0 + 1 = 1 |
| 2         | 4         | 1        | else     | 4 + 2 = 6       | 1 + 1 = 2 |
| 3         | 6         | 2        | else     | 6 + 2 = 8       | 2 + 1 = 3 |
| 4         | 8         | 3        | else     | 8 + 2 = 10      | 3 + 1 = 4 |
| 5         | 10        | 4        | else     | 10 + 2 = 12     | 4 + 1 = 5 |

Notice that after iteration `n`, when `t != 0`:
- `k = n`
- `j = 2 + 2 * k`

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (assertion):**

```c
(k != 0) ==> (t != 0 && j == k * 2 + 2)
```

- This means if `k` is not zero, then `t` is not zero and `j` equals `2 + 2*k`.
- The assertion addresses a relationship between `j` and `k` when `k` has been incremented (thus the loop executed the else branch at least once).

**Can the verification goal be part of the loop invariant?**

- **No**, *as is*: The post-condition requires `k != 0`, which cannot hold *before* the loop starts (since `k = 0` initially).
- The formula `j == 2 + 2*k` may not hold if `k == 0` — particularly if `t == 0` and the loop only increments `j` by 4.
- The assertion only speaks to the *case* when `k != 0`, i.e., it is vacuously true otherwise.

**Can it be modified to a valid loop invariant?**

Yes, by expressing the invariant as a conditional property that relates `j` and `k` depending on `t`:

- If `t == 0` then `k == 0` and `j == 2 + 4 * iteration_count`
- If `t != 0` then `j == 2 + 2*k`

Because `t` is constant during the loop, and `k` increments only if `t != 0`, the invariant can express:

```c
if (t == 0) {
    k == 0
} else {
    j == 2 + 2 * k
}
```

This invariant:

- Is true before the loop starts (`k=0`, `j=2`, invariant holds for both cases).
- Is preserved every iteration.
- Implies the post-condition when combined with termination and `k != 0`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

> Throughout the loop execution, the following holds:
> - If `t == 0`, then `k` remains zero, and `j` equals `2` plus `4` times the number of iterations executed.
> - Otherwise, if `t != 0`, then `j` equals `2` plus two times `k`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- Since `t` is never updated inside the loop, it is a loop-invariant itself.
- When `t == 0`:
  - The else branch never executes.
  - `k` remains zero.
  - `j` increases by `4` each iteration starting from 2.
- When `t != 0`:
  - The else branch executes every iteration.
  - Each iteration increments `j` by 2 and `k` by 1.
  - Therefore, `j` grows linearly with `k` by formula `j = 2 + 2*k`.

---

## e. Establishment

- Before the loop starts, variables are initialized as:

  - `j = 2`
  - `k = 0`
  - `t` unknown but fixed

- Check invariant:

  - If `t == 0`:
    - `k == 0` holds trivially (initialized).
    - Number of iterations is 0 → `j == 2` matches initial state.
  - If `t != 0`:
    - `k == 0` initially.
    - `j == 2 + 2*0 == 2` matches initial state.

- Thus, the invariant holds prior to the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

**Assume invariant holds at the start of an iteration and loop condition is true:**

- **Case 1: `t == 0`**

  - `k == 0`
  - `j == 2 + 4 * (i)` where `i` is the number of previous iterations.
  - Inside loop, `j` updated by `j = j + 4` → `2 + 4*i + 4 = 2 + 4*(i+1)`
  - `k` remains 0.
  - Invariant holds after iteration.

- **Case 2: `t != 0`**

  - `j == 2 + 2 * k`
  - `k` is incremented by 1
  - `j` increments 2, so `j_new = j + 2 = 2 + 2*k + 2 = 2 + 2*(k+1)`
  - `k_new = k + 1`
  - Invariant holds after iteration.

Hence, in both scenarios, the invariant is preserved.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.
- At termination, invariant holds (by preservation).
- Invariant states:

  - If `t == 0`, `k == 0`.
  - If `t != 0`, `j == 2 + 2*k`.

- This matches the scenario required to prove the assertion.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**

```c
(k != 0) ==> (t != 0 && j == k * 2 + 2);
```

- If `k` is not zero, then necessarily:

  - `t` must be nonzero (the `else` branch was taken).
  - `j == 2 + 2*k`

**Evaluate correctness:**

- This is logically correct given the invariant.

- When `k != 0`, the first branch (`t == 0`) cannot be true because `k` would remain 0 in that branch.

- So `t != 0` must hold.

- The formula `j == 2 + 2*k` is exactly the invariant’s relevant part for `t != 0`.

**Proof sketch:**

- From the invariant plus negation of the loop condition (termination):

  - At loop end invariant holds: if `k != 0`, `t != 0` and `j = 2 + 2*k`.
  - Post-condition is therefore directly implied.

---

# **Summary: Formal Loop Invariant**

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant 
    (t == 0 ==> k == 0)
    && 
    (t != 0 ==> j == 2 + 2 * k);
@*/
```

This invariant is:

- Established before the loop.
- Preserved during each iteration.
- Holds at termination.
- Implies the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 00:57:07,406 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `undef_data_at(&t) * (k == 0) * (j == 2)`

Loop program: `


void foo155() {

    int j;
    int k;
    int t;

    j = 2;
    k = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_k ;
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.
