```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose of the loop:**

The loop iterates while the variable `i` is less than or equal to 8. Within the loop:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `sn` is incremented by 1.

The intended outcome appears to be counting how many times the loop executes, by tracking increments in `sn`. After the loop terminates, the assertion checks that if `sn` is not zero, it must be exactly 8.

In essence, the loop counts the iterations it executes, which should be exactly 8 because `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time until it becomes greater than 8.

---

**Loop structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while (i <= 8)`
- **Loop body:**
  - `i = i + 1;`
  - `sn = sn + 1;`
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `i`: loop counter or index initialized to 1.
  - `sn`: a sum-like variable initialized to 0, incremented each iteration.

The loop terminates when `i > 8`.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Iteration | Start i | Start sn | After i = i+1 | After sn = sn+1 |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Pre-loop  | 1       | 0        | -             | -               |
| 1         | 1       | 0        | 2             | 1               |
| 2         | 2       | 1        | 3             | 2               |
| 3         | 3       | 2        | 4             | 3               |
| 4         | 4       | 3        | 5             | 4               |
| 5         | 5       | 4        | 6             | 5               |

---

The loop continues beyond the 5th iteration up to i reaching 9 (which breaks the loop). After the loop:

- Final state: `i = 9`, `sn = 8` (since `sn` increments once per iteration from `i=1` to `i=8`)

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal:** 

```c
assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);
```

More explicitly:

- If `sn` is not zero, then it must be exactly 8 at that point.

**Can this post-condition be used directly as a loop invariant?**

- **No.**

Why?

- Initially (before loop starts), `sn = 0`, so `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` holds vacuously (since `sn != 0` is false).
- However, during loop iterations when `sn` is between 1 and 7, the post-condition is violated if considered as an invariant, because at those points `sn != 0` but `sn != 8`.
- Therefore, the assertion as given is only meaningful after the loop ends, not during partial execution.

---

**Can the verification goal be modified into a suitable invariant fulfilling the 3 formal conditions?**

Yes. The underlying invariant property is about the relationship between `i` and `sn`.

From samples we see:

- Initially: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`
- After iteration 1: `i = 2`, `sn = 1`
- After iteration k: `i = 1 + k`, `sn = k`

So the invariant can be expressed as:

```
sn = i - 1
```

This relation holds at loop start and every iteration.

**Checking conditions:**

- Establishment: Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`, so `sn = i - 1` is true.
- Preservation: If `sn = i - 1` at the start of an iteration, then after incrementing `i` and `sn` by 1, `sn' = sn + 1` and `i' = i + 1` so `sn' = (i' - 1)` remains true.
- Termination: When `i > 8`, i.e., `i = 9`, then `sn = 9 - 1 = 8`, implying the post-condition `sn == 8` holds.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

*At the start and end of each loop iteration, the variable `sn` equals `i-1`.*

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Initialization satisfies it.
- The loop increments both `i` and `sn` by one each iteration, maintaining the difference `sn = i - 1`.
- The invariant succinctly expresses the internal state relationship that underlies the loop progress.
- It supports the post-condition reasoning ensuring that after loop terminates, `sn` equals 8.

---

## e. Establishment

Before entering the loop, the variables are set:

- `i = 1`
- `sn = 0`

Check invariant:

- Is `sn == i - 1`?
- `0 == 1 - 1` → `0 == 0` ✔️

Thus, the invariant is established by the initial assignments prior to the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

Assuming the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:

```
sn = i - 1
```

And the loop condition is true:

```
i <= 8
```

Loop body executes:

```
i = i + 1;    // i' = i + 1
sn = sn + 1;  // sn' = sn + 1
```

Check if invariant holds after iteration:

```
sn' = sn + 1
    = (i - 1) + 1
    = i

i' = i + 1

Check sn' == i' - 1 ?

i' -1 = (i + 1) - 1 = i

Therefore, sn' = i' - 1
```

So the invariant is preserved through the iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when:

```
i <= 8     // false, so i > 8
```

- Given that `i` increments by 1 each iteration, termination occurs when `i == 9`.

At termination:

- `i = 9`
- By invariant: `sn = i - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`

Thus, at loop termination, the invariant remains true, and we know exactly the value of `sn`.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

Provided post-condition:

```c
assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);
```

- Since after loop termination `sn = 8` and `sn != 0` is true, the assertion holds.
- Additionally, `sn` cannot be any value other than 0 or 8 on loop exit due to the structure of the loop:

  - If the loop runs at least once, `sn` increments from 0 to 8.
  - If loop does not run at all (which cannot happen here, since `i` starts at 1 ≤ 8), `sn` remains zero.

The assertion essentially says: if the loop ran (i.e., `sn != 0`), then it must have run exactly 8 times (`sn == 8`).

**How invariant proves post-condition:**

- The invariant: `sn = i - 1`
- Loop terminates at `i = 9`
- So `sn = 8`
- Therefore, `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` is true.

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| a. Purpose        | Count the number of times the loop executes, ending with sn=8. |
| b. Variables      | `i` from 1 to 9, incremented; `sn` counts iterations.          |
| c. Verification   | Post-condition can’t be used as invariant but `sn = i-1` can.   |
| d. Invariant      | `sn == i - 1`                                                   |
| e. Establishment  | Holds initially at `i = 1`, `sn = 0`                           |
| f. Preservation   | Adding 1 to both preserves `sn = i - 1`                        |
| g. Termination    | When `i = 9` loop ends, so `sn = 8`                            |
| h. Post-condition | Correct; follows from invariant and exit condition.            |

---

If desired, a formal annotation of the invariant can be expressed as:

```c
/*@ loop invariant sn == i - 1;
    loop invariant 1 <= i <= 9;
    loop assigns i, sn;
    loop variant 9 - i;
 */
```

This would formally capture the invariant, bounds, and termination metric for static analysis tools.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(sn == 0) * (i == 1)`

Loop program: `

void foo121() {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;
    
     
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_i ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_sn ;
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (i <= 8) {
  
      i  = (i + 1);
      sn  = (sn + 1);
      
    }
            
  
    /*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);*/
  
  }`
