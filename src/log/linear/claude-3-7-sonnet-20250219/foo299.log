# a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**

The loop increments variable `x` from 0 up to (but not including) 10,000,000, and conditionally increments `z` whenever `x` is greater than or equal to 5,000,000. The intended outcome is to prove a relationship between `z` and `x` at the end of the loop, specifically that `z == x`.

**Structure:**

- **Loop Condition:** `x < 10000000`
- **Loop Body:**
  - Checks if `x >= 5000000`. If true, increments `z`.
  - Increments `x` by 1 unconditionally each iteration.
- **Variables:**
  - `x`: loop counter starting at 0, advancing by 1 each iteration.
  - `z`: starts at 5,000,000 and increments based on condition inside loop.
  
Effectively:

- For `x` in `[0, 5000000)`, `z` remains unchanged.
- For `x` in `[5000000, 10000000)`, `z` increments each iteration.
  
---

# b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We track `(x, z)` before loop and after each of first 5 iterations.

| Iteration | Condition Check        | Action                  | x Value | z Value          | Explanation                         |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Pre-loop  | `x=0`, `z=5000000`    | —                       | 0       | 5,000,000        | Initialization                    |
| 1         | `x=0 < 10000000`      | x < 5000000 -> no z++   | 1       | 5,000,000        | `z` unchanged                     |
| 2         | `x=1 < 10000000`      | x < 5000000 -> no z++   | 2       | 5,000,000        | `z` unchanged                     |
| 3         | `x=2 < 10000000`      | x < 5000000 -> no z++   | 3       | 5,000,000        | `z` unchanged                     |
| 4         | `x=3 < 10000000`      | x < 5000000 -> no z++   | 4       | 5,000,000        | `z` unchanged                     |
| 5         | `x=4 < 10000000`      | x < 5000000 -> no z++   | 5       | 5,000,000        | `z` unchanged                     |

No increments to `z` yet due to `x` being less than 5,000,000.

For iterations near or above 5,000,000 (the real transition point), the behavior changes:

- At `x=4999999` (last no increment): `z` remains 5,000,000.
- At `x=5000000`: now condition `x >= 5000000` is true, so `z` increments.
  - After increment: `z = 5,000,001`, `x = 5,000,001`.
- Each iteration after this, `z` increments by 1 along with `x`.

---

# c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert z == x; */
```

At the end of the loop, when `x == 10000000`, we want to prove `z == x`.

- Initially, `x = 0`, `z = 5,000,000`.
- For `x` in `[0, 4999999]`, `z` stays constant at 5,000,000.
- For `x` in `[5000000, 9999999]`, `z` increments by 1 each iteration, incrementing a total of `10000000 - 5000000 = 5000000` times.

Therefore:

```
final z = initial z + increments
        = 5,000,000 + 5,000,000
        = 10,000,000 = final x
```

Hence, the post-condition `z == x` matches the final state.

---

**Can the assertion `z == x` be used as an invariant during the loop?**

- NO.

Why?

- Initially, before loop starts, `x = 0`, `z = 5,000,000`.
- `z == x` is **false** at the start (`5,000,000 != 0`), so it fails *establishment*.

**Can it be modified to form an invariant?**

Yes.

The nature of `z` and `x` inside the loop suggests a piecewise relationship depending on `x`:

- For small `x` (< 5,000,000), `z` is constant at 5,000,000.
- For large `x` (≥ 5,000,000), `z` increases with `x` but offset by 5,000,000.

A suitable invariant is:

\[
z = \max(x, 5000000)
\]

Or equivalently in logic:

- if `x < 5000000`: `z == 5000000`
- else: `z == x`

This invariant captures the stepwise nature and matches initial values as well as final conditions.

---

# d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**

> At the start and end of each iteration, the variable `z` equals either the current value of `x` if `x` is at least 5,000,000, or otherwise equals 5,000,000 (the initial value of `z`). Formally:
> 
> ```
> if (x < 5000000) 
>     then z == 5000000
> else 
>     z == x
> ```

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- At loop start: `x=0` < 5,000,000 and `z=5,000,000` holds trivially.
- Each iteration, if `x < 5000000`, `z` remains unchanged at 5,000,000.
- When `x` reaches 5,000,000 and beyond, each iteration increments both `x` and `z` so that `z` maintains equality with `x`.
- This invariant holds before and after each iteration since the conditional increment of `z` exactly enforces the switch from constant to linear growth.
- At termination (`x=10000000`), the invariant combined with loop exit implies `z == x`, matching the assertion.

---

# e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established before loop start:**

- Before the first iteration: `x=0`, `z=5000000`.
- Since `0 < 5000000`, invariant requires `z == 5000000` which is true.
- Therefore, the invariant is established by the initial assignments.

---

# f. Preservation

**Preservation proof:**

Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration with current `x` and `z`:

1. If `x < 5000000`, then `z == 5000000`.
    - Loop body: `if (x >= 5000000)` fails, so `z` stays the same.
    - `x` increments by 1: new `x` becomes `x+1`.
    - New `z` stays 5000000.
    - The invariant holds for new `x` and `z`:
      - If `x+1 < 5000000`, `z` remains `5000000`.
      - If `x+1 == 5000000`, invariant will switch to `z == x+1` next iteration.

2. If `x >= 5000000`, then `z == x`.
    - Loop body: `if (x >= 5000000)` true, so `z++`.
      - New `z` = old `z` + 1 = `x + 1`.
    - `x` increments by 1: new `x` = `x + 1`.
    - New invariant:
      - `z == x` since `z == x + 1` and `x` updated to `x + 1`.
    - The invariant holds.

Therefore, preservation condition is satisfied.

---

# g. Termination Analysis

**When the loop terminates:**

- Loop condition fails when `x >= 10000000`.
- Specifically, termination at `x == 10000000`.
- According to the invariant:
  - Since `x >= 5000000`, `z == x`.
  - Therefore, `z == 10000000`.
  
Invariant remains valid.

---

# h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:** `z == x`

- Is it correct? YES, as the above analysis shows.

**How invariant + loop exit imply post-condition:**

- Loop exit: `!(x < 10000000) ⇒ x >= 10000000`
- By invariant, when `x >= 5000000`, `z == x`.
- At loop exit, `x == 10000000` (exact termination).
- So together:

\[
\text{Invariant} \wedge \neg \text{LoopCondition} 
\implies (z = x) \wedge (x \geq 10000000) 
\implies z = x = 10000000
\]

- This directly matches the asserted post-condition.

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Loop purpose**      | Increment `x` from 0 → 10,000,000, conditionally increment `z` when `x >= 5,000,000`.           |
| **Variables**         | `x` loop counter; `z` increments conditionally from 5,000,000 upwards.                          |

| **Post 1–5 iterations**| `x` increments by 1; `z` unchanged (since `x < 5,000,000`).                                  |
| **Verification goal** | Assert `z == x` after the loop. Not invariant initially, but true at loop exit.                 |
| **Modified invariant**| If `x < 5,000,000`, `z == 5,000,000`; else `z == x`.                                          |
| **Establishment**     | Holds at loop start because `x=0 < 5,000,000` and `z=5,000,000`.                               |
| **Preservation**      | Adjusts `z` and `x` maintaining invariant stepwise for both regions of `x`.                    |
| **Termination**       | At loop end, `x=10,000,000`, `z=10,000,000` consistent with invariant.                          |
| **Post-condition**    | Proven correct by invariant + negated loop condition.                                          |

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 04:43:08,697 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(z == 5000000) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `

void foo299() {

    int x;
    int z;

    x = 0;
    z = 5000000;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_z ;
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while(x < 10000000){
       if(x >= 5000000)
       z++;
       x++;
      }
            

    /*@ assert z == x; */

- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.
