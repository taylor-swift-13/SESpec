2025-12-23 06:37:22,350 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Let's perform a detailed loop verification analysis for the given code snippet following the requested structure.

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop iterates from `l = 0` up to (but not including) `l = n`. At each iteration, it increments one of four counters (`v4`, `i`, `j`, or `k`) based on the divisibility of the loop index `l` by 4, 3, or 2. More specifically:

- If `l` is divisible by 4, increment `v4`.
- Else if divisible by 3, increment `i`.
- Else if divisible by 2, increment `j`.
- Otherwise, increment `k`.

This effectively partitions the range `[0, n-1]` into four disjoint categories based on divisibility and counts how many indices fall into each category.

---

**Loop Structure:**

- **Condition:** `while (l < n)` — the loop continues incrementing `l` until `l` reaches `n`.
- **Body:**
  - Check divisibility of `l` in order: 4, then 3, then 2.
  - Increment exactly one counter depending on this divisibility.
  - Increment loop variable `l` by 1.

**Relevant variables:**

- `n`: upper bound on `l`, input to the function.
- Loop counter `l`.
- Counters `v4`, `i`, `j`, `k` which accumulate counts based on conditions.
- `unsigned int` for all variables (non-negative).

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's denote the variables as tuples `(l, v4, i, j, k)` sampled at various points.

- Initial values **before** loop starts (pre-loop sampling):

  ```
  l = 0
  v4 = 0
  i = 0
  j = 0
  k = 0
  ```

---

### Iteration 1 (l = 0 before increment)

- Check `(0 % 4) == 0` → true.
- Increment `v4`: v4 = 0 + 1 = 1
- `i, j, k` remain 0.
- Increment `l`: l = 0 + 1 = 1

*After iteration 1:*

```
l = 1
v4 = 1
i = 0
j = 0
k = 0
```

---

### Iteration 2 (l = 1 before increment)

- `(1 % 4) == 0` ? No
- `(1 % 3) == 0` ? No
- `(1 % 2) == 0` ? No
- Else increment `k`: k = 0 + 1 = 1
- Increment `l` = 1 + 1 = 2

*After iteration 2:*

```
l = 2
v4 = 1
i = 0
j = 0
k = 1
```

---

### Iteration 3 (l = 2 before increment)

- `(2 % 4) == 0` ? No
- `(2 % 3) == 0` ? No
- `(2 % 2) == 0` ? Yes
- Increment `j`: j = 0 + 1 = 1
- Increment `l` = 2 + 1 = 3

*After iteration 3:*

```
l = 3
v4 = 1
i = 0
j = 1
k = 1
```

---

### Iteration 4 (l = 3 before increment)

- `(3 % 4) == 0` ? No
- `(3 % 3) == 0` ? Yes
- Increment `i`: i = 0 + 1 = 1
- Increment `l` = 3 + 1 = 4

*After iteration 4:*

```
l = 4
v4 = 1
i = 1
j = 1
k = 1
```

---

### Iteration 5 (l = 4 before increment)

- `(4 % 4) == 0` ? Yes
- Increment `v4`: v4 = 1 + 1 = 2
- Increment `l` = 4 + 1 = 5

*After iteration 5:*

```
l = 5
v4 = 2
i = 1
j = 1
k = 1
```

---

### Summary of sampled states:

| Iteration | l (after) | v4 | i | j | k |
|-----------|-----------|----|---|---|---|
| Pre-loop | 0         | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1         | 1         | 1  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2         | 2         | 1  | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 3         | 3         | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 4         | 4         | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 5         | 5         | 2  | 1 | 1 | 1 |

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Post-condition:**

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4); */
```

This is incomplete as shown: it states "`assert (i + j + k + v4);`" which in C asserts that the sum is nonzero. Since the loop increments one counter each iteration and runs for `n` iterations, the post-condition probably intends to assert something like:

```
i + j + k + v4 == n
```

That is, the sum of all counts equals the number of iterations completed.

---

### Can the post-condition serve as a loop invariant?

- **No** — The post-condition “`i + j + k + v4 == n`” can only be true when the loop finishes (since `l` goes from 0 to `n-1`, the counters collectively count `n` iterations).

- During the iterations, since `l < n` and is incremented after one counter increments, the sum `i + j + k + v4` equals `l` (the current iteration count), which changes each iteration.

- So the exact post-condition cannot be an invariant because it depends on the final value of `l`.

---

### Can the post-condition be modified for an invariant?

- Yes. Since at every iteration exactly one of the counters increments *and* `l` represents iteration count, the following holds at all times:

```
i + j + k + v4 == l
```

- This relates the counters to `l` at every iteration and can serve as a loop invariant.

- Also, the counters are all ≥ 0, and `0 ≤ l ≤ n`.

- When the loop ends (`l == n`), the invariant implies the post-condition.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

### Proposed loop invariant (natural language):

**Invariant:** At the beginning (and end) of every loop iteration, the sum of all counters `i + j + k + v4` equals the current value of `l`, where `l` is the loop iteration count. Formally:

```
0 ≤ l ≤ n
i + j + k + v4 == l
```

Moreover, all counters are non-negative integers.

---

### Why is this invariant valid?

- The loop increments exactly one counter each iteration corresponding to the value of `l`.

- After incrementing the correct counter, `l` increments by 1.

- Therefore, the total increments accumulated by the counters equal the current loop index `l`.

- Since counters start at zero and only increment by 1 per iteration, this relation holds strictly.

---

## e. Establishment

Before the first iteration:

- `l = 0`

- All counters are zero:

  ```
  i = j = k = v4 = 0
  ```

- Sum of counters is zero.

Therefore:

```
i + j + k + v4 == 0 == l
```

holds before entering the loop and within the loop condition `l < n` (since `n >= 0`).

Thus, the invariant is **established** prior to the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

Assuming the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration:

```
i + j + k + v4 == l
```

and `l < n` (loop condition true).

During the iteration:

- Exactly one counter (`v4`, `i`, `j`, or `k`) is incremented by 1.

- Then `l` is incremented by 1.

After these increments:

- New sum of counters = old sum + 1 = `l + 1`

- New `l` = old `l + 1`

Therefore, at the end of the iteration:

```
i + j + k + v4 == l
```

So the invariant is **preserved** through each iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates:

- Loop condition `l < n` is false, so:

  ```
  l >= n
  ```

- Since `l` increments by 1 each iteration and stops at `n`, `l == n` is guaranteed.

From the invariant:

```
i + j + k + v4 == l == n
```

So the sum of counters equals `n`.

---

The invariant remains **valid** at termination because `l = n` and counters sum to `n`.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

The given post-condition is:

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4); */
```

This is likely incomplete or shorthand.

Assuming the intended post-condition is:

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 == n); */
```

- From the loop invariant and termination analysis, we have:

  ```
  i + j + k + v4 == l == n
  ```

- Since the loop ended because `l == n`, the assertion holds.

---

### Conclusion on correctness:

- The **invariant**, combined with the **negation of the loop condition** (`l < n` is false → `l == n`), **implies the post-condition** that the sum of counters equals `n`.

- This establishes the **correctness** of the counters summing exactly `n` after the loop completes.

/*@ 
  loop invariant 0 <= l <= n;
  loop invariant i + j + k + v4 == l;
  loop invariant i >= 0 && j >= 0 && k >= 0 && v4 >= 0;

while (l < n) {
  if ((l % 4) == 0) {
    v4 = v4 + 1;
  }
  else if((l % 3) == 0){
    i = i + 1;
  }
  else if((l % 2) == 0){
    j = j + 1;

2025-12-23 06:37:22,380 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: ``

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires n <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo308(unsigned int n) {

2025-12-23 06:40:16,805 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Let’s conduct a thorough loop verification analysis of the given C code snippet step-by-step following the requested structure.

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**

The loop iterates from `l = 0` to `l = n - 1` and classifies each number `l` based on its divisibility by 4, 3, or 2 (in that order), incrementing a respective counter:

- If `l % 4 == 0`, increment `v4`.
- Else if `l % 3 == 0`, increment `i`.
- Else if `l % 2 == 0`, increment `j`.
- Otherwise, increment `k`.

In essence, the loop categorizes numbers `[0, n-1]` into four disjoint sets based on divisibility rules and counts how many fall into each category.

**Loop Structure:**

- Loop Condition: `while (l < n)`
- Loop Index: `l` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- Variables updated in the body:
  - `v4`: count of numbers divisible by 4.
  - `i`: count of numbers divisible by 3 but not by 4.
  - `j`: count of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3 or 4.
  - `k`: count of numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 4.
- Auxiliary variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `v4`, and `l` are unsigned integers, initialized to 0.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We sample the initial values and then values after each iteration up to iteration 5.

| Iteration | l | l % 4 == 0? | l % 3 == 0? | l % 2 == 0? | v4 | i | j | k |
|-----------|---|--------------|-------------|-------------|----|---|---|---|
| Initial (before loop) | 0 | - | - | - | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| After 1st iteration (l=0 processed) | 1 | true (0%4=0) | - | - | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| After 2nd iteration (l=1 processed) | 2 | false | false | false | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| After 3rd iteration (l=2 processed) | 3 | false | false | true (2%2=0) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| After 4th iteration (l=3 processed) | 4 | false | true (3%3=0) | true | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| After 5th iteration (l=4 processed) | 5 | true (4%4=0) | false | true | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Detailed explanation:

- At `l=0`: divisible by 4 → `v4=1`
- At `l=1`: none of the conditions → `k=1`
- At `l=2`: divisible by 2 only → `j=1`
- At `l=3`: divisible by 3 only → `i=1`
- At `l=4`: divisible by 4 → `v4=2`

After five iterations, the variables count how many numbers so far fall into each classification.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4); */
```

The `assert` is somewhat imprecise or incomplete—just `(i + j + k + v4)` by itself is not a boolean expression but a sum of counts, which as an integer will always be ≥ 0 and true as non-zero when sum > 0.

Most likely, the intended post-condition is to assert:

- That the sum of the counts equals `n`, i.e.,

```c
assert(i + j + k + v4 == n);
```

This makes sense because the loop processes every `l` from `0` to `n-1`, always increments exactly one of the counters, so at termination the sum of all counters should equal `n`.

**Can this serve as loop invariant?**

- **No**, the post-condition `i + j + k + v4 == n` is not true before the loop begins when `l=0` and all counters are zero (`i+j+k+v4=0`), but `n` could be > 0.

- It is also not true during the loop iterations for the same reason: the counters count how many indices processed so far; before processing completes, sum < n.

**Modification to make a valid invariant:**

Change it to:

```c
i + j + k + v4 == l
```

This states that at any point in the loop, the sum of the counters equals the number of iterations completed (`l`).

- Establishment: Initially `l=0`, all counters zero, sum=0 → holds.
- Preservation: Each iteration increments exactly one of the counters and `l` is incremented by 1 → sum increments by 1 matching `l`.
- Termination: When `l == n` (loop exit condition), sum = n, so the post-condition holds.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**

> At the start of each loop iteration and after executing any iteration of the loop, the variable `l` precisely counts how many iterations have been completed, and the sum of the counters `i + j + k + v4` equals `l`. Furthermore, for all indices processed `[0, l - 1]`, exactly one of the counters (`i`, `j`, `k`, or `v4`) has been incremented according to the divisibility classification rules.

**Formalized invariant:**

```c
/*@
  0 <= l <= n &&
  i + j + k + v4 == l &&
  For all x in [0 .. l-1]:
    if (x % 4 == 0) then v4 counts x
    else if (x % 3 == 0) then i counts x
    else if (x % 2 == 0) then j counts x
    else k counts x
@*/
```

**Why valid:**

- `l` is the current iteration count.
- The logic guarantees exactly one counter increments each iteration.
- Hence the invariant holds before loop starts (`l=0`, counters=0).
- After each iteration, one counter increments and `l` increments, so sum remains equal.
- This tracks consistent partitioning of numbers `[0 .. l-1]` into mutually exclusive categories.

---

### e. Establishment

**How invariant holds before first iteration:**

- Pre-condition guarantees `n <= 20000001`, which ensures the loop bound is reasonable (no overflow concerns).
- Initially:

```c
l = 0;
i = j = k = v4 = 0;
```

- Sum: `i + j + k + v4 = 0` which equals `l = 0`.

- Hence, `0 <= l <= n` and `sum = l` hold, establishing the invariant before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

**Invariant preservation proof:**

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration: `0 <= l < n`, `i + j + k + v4 == l`.
- Loop condition `l < n` is true, loop executes.
- `l` is processed according to classification, one counter (say `C`) increments by 1, and all others unchanged.
- Then `l` is incremented by 1.
- After iteration:

``` 
i + j + k + v4 == l (old) + 1 == l (new)
```

- Hence sum equals new `l`.
- Since `l` increased by 1 and counters updated accordingly:
  
```
0 <= l <= n remains true
```

- The partitioning logic ensures counters still correctly reflect classification of `[0 ... l-1]`.

Therefore, the invariant holds after each iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**At loop termination:**

- Loop condition: `l < n` becomes false → `l == n`.
- Variables at this point:

```
l == n
i + j + k + v4 == l == n
```

- Indicates the sum of counters equals total iterations processed.
- Since the loop processed all `l` from `0` to `n-1`, and each number increments a classifier counter, this matches expectations.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Original post-condition given:**

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4); */
```

- As stated before, this asserts a nonzero sum, which is almost meaningless by itself.
- The correct useful post-condition should be:

```c
assert(i + j + k + v4 == n);
```

meaning all `n` elements were counted exactly once.

**Does invariant + loop termination prove this?**

- Invariant: `i + j + k + v4 == l` for all iterations.
- At termination: `l == n`.
- Therefore by substitution:

```
i + j + k + v4 == n
```

- Hence, the invariant combined with loop exit conditions implies the correct post-condition.

**Final remarks:**

- The original assertion should be corrected to reflect the equality.
- The loop invariant proposed allows formal, inductive proof of the counting correctness.

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Loop invariant               | `i + j + k + v4 == l`                             |
| Established before loop      | `l=0`, counters=0, sum=0                          |
| Preserved each iteration     | Exactly one counter increments, `l` increments   |
| Loop termination condition   | `l == n`                                         |
| Invariant at termination     | `i + j + k + v4 == n`                             |
| Correct post-condition       | `assert(i + j + k + v4 == n);`                    |

- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

Pre-condition: ``

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###

- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
