---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
The loop iterates to increment the variable `j` starting from 0 until one of two limits is reached:

- `j` reaches `idBitLength / 8`
- or `j` reaches `material_length`

In other words, the loop counts up `j` until `j` is at least as large as both these limits' minimum. Given that `idBitLength` and `material_length` represent lengths or sizes (likely in bytes or units), the loop effectively computes:

> `j = min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)`

**Structure:**

- Loop condition (guard):  
  ```c
  (j < idBitLength / 8) && (j < material_length)
  ```
- Loop body:  
  ```c
  j = j + 1;
  ```
- Variables relevant to behavior:  
  - `j`: loop counter, starts at 0, incremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `idBitLength`: input parameter; positive or zero; expects `idBitLength / 8` to represent a byte count.
  - `material_length`: input parameter; non-negative length count.
  - `nlen` is unused inside the loop.

The loop runs as long as `j` is less than both limits. The loop body increments `j` by 1 each iteration, moving `j` closer to one or both bounds.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Given the precondition:  
```c
/*@ requires nlen == idBitLength / 32 && idBitLength >= 0 && material_length >= 0; */
```

We have some constraints but no concrete values. For sampling, assume some positive values for demonstration:  
- `idBitLength = 64` (so `idBitLength / 8 = 8`)  
- `material_length = 10` (greater than 8)  

**Pre-Loop Sample (before entering the loop):**  
- `j = 0`  
- Condition: `(0 < 8) && (0 < 10)` → `true`

**Post-Iteration Samples:** (after each increment)

1. After 1st iteration:  
   - `j = 1`  
   - Condition check for next iteration: `(1 < 8) && (1 < 10)` → `true`
   
2. After 2nd iteration:  
   - `j = 2`  
   - Condition: `(2 < 8) && (2 < 10)` → `true`

3. After 3rd iteration:  
   - `j = 3`  
   - Condition: `(3 < 8) && (3 < 10)` → `true`

4. After 4th iteration:  
   - `j = 4`  
   - Condition: `(4 < 8) && (4 < 10)` → `true`

5. After 5th iteration:  
   - `j = 5`  
   - Condition: `(5 < 8) && (5 < 10)` → `true`

(Additional iterations would continue until `j == 8`, since `8 < 10` but `j < 8` will become false at `j=8`.)  

**Post-Loop Sample (upon loop termination):**  
- Loop exits when `(j < 8) && (j < 10)` is false.  
- Since 10 is larger, the condition fails because `j < 8` is false → `j == 8`.  
- So, final `j = 8`.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**  
```c
/*@ assert (j / 4); */
```

This assertion expects that integer division `j/4` is non-zero (non-zero integer values in `assert` statements are considered true). 

- `assert(j/4)` means `j/4 != 0` → `j >= 4` (since integer division rounds down).

**Can this post-condition serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- **NO**. Because at the pre-loop state, `j = 0`, and `j/4 == 0`, so it is not true before the loop starts.
- Thus, the post-condition is **not** true at the start and so cannot serve as a loop invariant.

**Can the post-condition be modified into a valid invariant?**

We want a loop invariant `I(j)` that:

1. Holds before the loop (when `j = 0`).
2. Preserved by the loop body.
3. At termination combined with the negation of the loop guard implies the post-condition `j / 4 != 0` (i.e., `j >= 4`).

Because `j` increments from 0 upwards, but assertion requires `j >= 4` at the end, the loop must run enough iterations to reach at least 4.

**Idea:** The loop invariant can express a bound on `j` that captures progress:

- `0 <= j <= min(idBitLength/8, material_length)`

We cannot enforce `j >= 4` during the loop because initially it’s zero. But we can establish that the final `j` after loop termination is exactly `min(idBitLength/8, material_length)`.

Thus, the post-condition requires that `min(idBitLength/8, material_length) >= 4` for the assertion to hold after the loop runs fully.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed valid loop invariant (in natural language):**

> *At the start of every iteration and after every iteration, the variable `j` satisfies:  
> `0 <= j <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)`.*

**Explanation:**

- `j` starts at 0 (non-negative).
- On every iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
- The loop guard ensures the loop runs only while `j < idBitLength/8` and `j < material_length`.
- Therefore, before and after every iteration, `j` is bounded above by the minimum of these two limits.
- This invariant expresses the valid range of `j` throughout the loop execution.
- It is true initially, and remains true because `j` only increases by 1 within the bounds.

---

### e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established before the first iteration?**

- Precondition: `j = 0`.
- Since `idBitLength >= 0` and `material_length >= 0` (given by the `requires` annotation).
- So,
  ```
  0 <= 0 <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
  ```
- This confirms the invariant holds before entering the loop.

---

### f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved during iterations?**

Assume:  
At start of iteration, the invariant holds:

```
0 <= j <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

and loop condition is true:

```
j < idBitLength / 8 && j < material_length
```

In the loop body, `j` becomes `j + 1`.

Check that invariant still holds after increment:

- Since `j < min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)`, `j + 1 <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)`.
- Also, since `j >= 0`, `j + 1 >= 1 >= 0`.
- Therefore:

```
0 <= j + 1 <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

Invariant is preserved.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**Variables at loop termination:**

- Loop exits when:

```
!(j < idBitLength / 8 && j < material_length)
```

which is equivalent to:

```
(j >= idBitLength / 8) || (j >= material_length)
```

Since `j` remains ≤ both limits during loop execution, the only way to break is when `j` reaches at least one of these limits.

**Why invariant remains valid:**

- From the invariant, we have at loop end:

```
j <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

- Since loop stops only if `j >= idBitLength / 8` OR `j >= material_length`, combining with this:

```
j >= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

because `j` cannot exceed the minimum of both.

Therefore:

```
j == min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

The invariant still holds (since equality is ≤).

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**  
```c
/*@ assert (j / 4); */
```

Meaning: `j / 4 != 0` → `j >= 4`

**Is this always correct?**

- Not necessarily.

- From termination analysis:

```
j = min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

- For `j / 4` to be non-zero we need:

```
min(idBitLength / 8, material_length) >= 4
```

- Without additional assumptions, `idBitLength / 8` or `material_length` could be less than 4, making the assertion false.

- So, **assertion correctness depends on inputs**.

**How invariant and loop termination prove the post-condition?**

Given the invariant `0 <= j <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)`, and after loop termination:

```
j == min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)
```

If the precondition guaranteed:

```
min(idBitLength / 8, material_length) >= 4
```

then:

```
j >= 4
```

and `j / 4` would be non-zero, satisfying the assertion.

| **Preserved by loop body**  | Each iteration increments `j` by 1, remaining within bounds from the guard  |
| **Termination condition**   | Loop exits when `j == min(idBitLength / 8, material_length)`                |
| **Post-condition**          | Requires `j / 4 != 0` → `j >= 4`                                          |
| **Correctness depends on**  | `min(idBitLength / 8, material_length) >= 4` established in precondition   |

---

### Proposed Loop Invariant Annotation (formal):

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant 0 <= j <= min(idBitLength / 8, material_length);
*/
```

---

If the goal is to prove the assert without assumptions, the precondition should be strengthened to guarantee:

```c
min(idBitLength / 8, material_length) >= 4
```

Otherwise, the assertion as given is not always verifiable.

- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(nlen,Pre) == \at(idBitLength,Pre) / 32 && \at(idBitLength,Pre) >= 0 && \at(material_length,Pre) >= 0 && undef_data_at(&k) * (j == 0) * (nlen == \at(nlen,Pre)) * (material_length == \at(material_length,Pre)) * (idBitLength == \at(idBitLength,Pre))`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires nlen == idBitLength / 32 && idBitLength >= 0 && material_length >= 0;
    */
    
void foo248(int idBitLength, int material_length, int nlen) {

    int j;
    int k;

2025-12-23 01:57:29,155 - DEBUG  - 1. **Error Analysis:**

- **Goal Establishment of Invariant Failed:**  
  The invariant `((\at(idBitLength,Pre) / 8) >= 4 && \at(material_length,Pre) >= 4) ==> (j / 4)` asserts `j/4` when both lengths are ≥ 4, but initially `j == 0` so `j/4 == 0`, failing establishment. The invariant is too strong at loop entry.

- **Goal Assertion Failed:**  
  The current invariant does not guarantee `j >= 4` at loop end unless we know `min(idBitLength/8, material_length) >= 4`. We need to strengthen the invariant to reflect that `j` reaches the minimum of these values and that if that minimum is at least 4, the assertion follows.

---

2. **Fixed C Code:**

```c
/*@
    requires nlen == idBitLength / 32 && idBitLength >= 0 && material_length >= 0;
*/
    
void foo248(int idBitLength, int material_length, int nlen) {

    int j;
    int k;

    j = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant 0 <= j <= \at(idBitLength,Pre) / 8;
      loop invariant 0 <= j <= \at(material_length,Pre);
      loop invariant nlen == \at(nlen,Pre);
      loop invariant material_length == \at(material_length,Pre);

    while((j < idBitLength / 8) && (j < material_length)){
       j = j + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (j >= 4); */

}
```

---

This invariant:

- Is established initially (`j == 0` lies within bounds).
- Preserved after each increment (`j` increments by 1 but never exceeds either bound).
- At loop termination, `j == min(idBitLength/8, material_length)`, so if `min(idBitLength / 8, material_length) >= 4`, the postcondition `j >= 4` holds.

*Note:* The assertion was changed to `j >= 4` for clarity in ACSL; `assert(j / 4)` is a common idiom meaning the same, but explicit comparison is clearer for proof. If you want to keep `assert(j / 4);` replace it.
