}
```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop repeatedly increments the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` by fixed amounts (1, 2, and 3 respectively) as long as the function `unknown()` returns true.
- The overall purpose appears to be accumulating counts or totals in these variables, increasing linearly on each iteration.
- Since `unknown()` is an external unknown predicate, it governs how many times the loop runs, which is not concretely determined in the code snippet.
- After the loop finishes, there is an assertion that `z >= 0`. The goal appears to ensure that the increment operations do not violate a simple property about `z` (non-negativity).

**Loop Structure:**

- The loop is a `while` loop with condition `unknown()`. We do not know how many and when iterations happen.
- The loop body contains three assignment operations:
  - `x = x + 1;`
  - `y = y + 2;`
  - `z = z + 3;`
- Variables `x`, `y`, `z` are initialized to zero before the loop.
- Relevant variables: `x`, `y`, `z` clearly, as they are updated inside the loop; also the predicate `unknown()` controls loop continuation.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- Initial values before loop starts (pre-loop):
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`

Now let’s simulate variable values after each iteration.

| Iteration | x        | y         | z         |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 (start)| 0        | 0         | 0         |
| 1         | 0 + 1 = 1| 0 + 2 = 2 | 0 + 3 = 3 |
| 2         | 1 + 1 = 2| 2 + 2 = 4 | 3 + 3 = 6 |
| 3         | 2 + 1 = 3| 4 + 2 = 6 | 6 + 3 = 9 |
| 4         | 3 + 1 = 4| 6 + 2 = 8 | 9 + 3 = 12|
| 5         | 4 + 1 = 5| 8 + 2 = 10| 12 +3 = 15|

- Post-loop sampling depends on when `unknown()` returns false.
- Since we do not have concrete termination, we only know that these variables monotonically increase by fixed steps each iteration.
- Crucially, note that all variables stay non-negative throughout, being sums of zero and positive increments.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**

- `z >= 0`

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**

- The goal is to prove `z` is non-negative after the loop finishes.
- Is `z >= 0` true during the loop execution?

  - Initially, `z = 0`, so `z >= 0` is true before the loop.
  - Each iteration increments `z` by 3, so `z` remains ≥ 0 at all times.
  - Therefore, `z >= 0` holds before, during, and after the loop.

- So YES, the verification goal `z >= 0` can be used as part of the loop invariant because it is always true, starting from initialization and remains true throughout the loop execution.

**If it were not directly usable**, we could generalize to an invariant reflecting how `z` grows linearly by 3 every iteration, but here it’s straightforward.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

- "`z` is always greater than or equal to zero throughout the execution of the loop."

More precise and complete invariant capturing the variable relationships and structure:

- "At the start of every iteration:
   - `x`, `y`, and `z` have values that correspond to the number of completed iterations times their incremental amounts.
   - More specifically, there exists an integer `n ≥ 0` (number of completed iterations) such that:
     - `x = n`
     - `y = 2 * n`
     - `z = 3 * n`
   - As a consequence, `z >= 0` always holds true."

**Explanation of why valid:**

- Initially, `n = 0` so all variables are zero.
- Each iteration increments each variable by fixed amounts, maintaining the linear relationship to the number of iterations.
- The invariant captures this relationship, which holds at start and end of every iteration (if true at start of iteration `k`, after increment it holds for iteration `k+1`).
- Since `n ≥ 0`, `z = 3 * n` implies `z >= 0`. This explicitly justifies the post-condition `z >= 0`.

---

## e. Establishment

- At the very start, before the first iteration:
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
- Corresponds exactly to `n = 0` completed iterations.
- Thus, the invariant with `n = 0` is true initially.
- Hence, establishment holds by initialization.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at the start of iteration `k` for some `k ≥ 0`:
  - `x = k`
  - `y = 2 * k`
  - `z = 3 * k`
- On the `k+1`th iteration (assuming `unknown()` is true and loop body executes):
  - `x = k + 1`
  - `y = 2 * k + 2 = 2 * (k + 1)`
  - `z = 3 * k + 3 = 3 * (k + 1)`
- So the invariant form holds again with `n = k + 1`.
- Therefore, preservation condition is met.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- When loop terminates, `unknown()` evaluates to false, so no further increments happen.
- Let the number of completed iterations be `N ≥ 0`.
- At termination:
  - `x = N`
  - `y = 2 * N`
  - `z = 3 * N`
- Since `N ≥ 0`, `z = 3 * N ≥ 0`.
- The invariant still holds because it is true at the start of the (non-executed) next iteration, and by extension, still true upon loop exit.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition `z >= 0` is correct.
- The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`unknown() == false`), implies that the loop has finished executing some non-negative number of iterations.
- Since `z = 3 * n` for that number `n`, it follows directly that `z >= 0`.
- Hence, the assertion is validly proven by the loop invariant and termination condition.

---

# **Summary**

### Complete Loop Invariant (formal style):

```c
/*@
  loop invariant \exists int n; n >= 0 && x == n && y == 2*n && z == 3*n;
@*/
```

### Explanation:

- Initially true (`n=0`).
- Preserved by each loop iteration (increments correspond to incrementing `n` by 1).
- On termination, implies the post-condition `z >= 0` since `z == 3*n` with `n >= 0`.
