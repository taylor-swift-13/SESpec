---

### Code snippet:
```c
void foo208() {
    int x;
    x = 0;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */
    while(x < 6){
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x == 6; */
}
```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose:**  
  The loop is designed to increment the integer variable `x` starting from 0 until it reaches 6. Its intended outcome is to precisely increase `x` by 1 on each iteration until the loop condition (`x < 6`) becomes false, meaning `x` has reached 6.
  
- **Loop structure:**  
  - **Governing condition:** `while (x < 6)`  
    This condition controls loop execution, checking whether `x` is less than 6.  
  - **Loop body operation:** `x = x + 1;`  
    On each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1.  
  - **Relevant variable:** Only `x` affects and changes during the loop execution and determination of continuation.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Sampling point             | Description              | x Value |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Pre-Loop Sampling         | Before loop starts        | 0       |
| Post-Iteration 1          | After 1st loop iteration  | 1       |
| Post-Iteration 2          | After 2nd loop iteration  | 2       |
| Post-Iteration 3          | After 3rd loop iteration  | 3       |
| Post-Iteration 4          | After 4th loop iteration  | 4       |
| Post-Iteration 5          | After 5th loop iteration  | 5       |
| Post-Loop Sampling        | After loop exits (end)    | 6       |

- At each iteration, `x` increments by 1 as expected.
- The loop terminates immediately after `x` is incremented from 5 to 6 because now `x < 6` becomes false.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification goal (post-condition):**  
  `x == 6` at the end of the function.

- **Can this goal serve as a loop invariant?**  
  NO, it cannot be used *directly* as a loop invariant because:  
  - At the start and during most iterations, `x == 6` is false (e.g., initially `x = 0`).  
  - The invariant must hold at every iteration start and end, but the post-condition only holds once the loop completes.

- **Can it be modified into an invariant?**  
  YES. We can modify the goal to a stronger inductive invariant:  
  **Proposed invariant:** `0 <= x <= 6` and `x` only increases by 1 each iteration, never exceeding 6.

- **Why this modification?**  
  - This modified invariant holds before the loop begins (`x = 0` satisfies `0 <= x <= 6`).  
  - It holds after each iteration since `x` increments by 1 but does not exceed 6.  
  - When the loop terminates (i.e., `x < 6` is false), we know `x >= 6`. Combined with the invariant `x <= 6`, we conclude `x == 6`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Invariant in natural language:**  
  "At the start and end of each loop iteration, the integer variable `x` is at least 0 and at most 6."

- **Why is this invariant valid?**  
  - Initially, `x = 0` which lies between 0 and 6.  
  - On each iteration, `x` increases by 1, keeping `x` in the range `[0,6]`.  
  - The loop condition ensures `x < 6` during iterations, so `x` cannot jump beyond 6 within the loop body.  
  - When the loop exits, `x` is at least 6, enforcing the upper bound.

---

## e. Establishment

- Before entering the loop: `x = 0`.  
- Because the proposed invariant requires `0 <= x <= 6`, and `x` is initialized to 0, the invariant holds before the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `0 <= x <= 6`, and the loop condition `x < 6` is true.  
- Because `x < 6`, incrementing `x` by 1 results in `x + 1 <= 6`.  
- Thus after `x = x + 1;`, the new value of `x` remains within the bounds `[0, 6]`.  
- Therefore, the invariant holds at the end of this iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- The loop condition `x < 6` becomes false when `x >= 6`.  
- From the invariant `x <= 6` and the negated condition `x >= 6`, it follows that `x == 6` when the loop terminates.  
- Hence the invariant remains valid at termination, and the loop exits with `x` exactly equal to 6.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition is `x == 6`.  
- This is correct given the reasoning above: the invariant `0 <= x <= 6` combined with loop termination (`x >= 6`) implies `x == 6`.  
- Formally:  
  - Loop exits ⇒ `!(x < 6)` ⇒ `x >= 6`  
  - From invariant, `x <= 6`  
  - Together, `x == 6`  
- Therefore, the assertion `x == 6` holds after the loop.

---

# Summary: Complete loop invariant annotation (example syntax for formal spec comments)

/*@  
  Loop invariant: 0 <= x <= 6;  
  Loop decreases: 6 - x;  
@*/

Applied in code as:

```c
void foo208() {
    int x = 0;

    /*@ 
      loop invariant 0 <= x <= 6;
      loop assigns x;
      loop variant 6 - x;
    @*/
    while (x < 6) {
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x == 6; */
}
```

---

**In conclusion**, this analysis shows that the loop increments `x` from 0 to 6, maintaining the invariant that `x` lies between 0 and 6 throughout. The invariant holds initially, is preserved by each iteration, and together with loop termination implies that `x` ends exactly at 6, proving the assertion.
