### Given code snippet

```c
int unknown();
/*@ requires x == 1 || x == 2; */
void foo229(int x) {

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */
    while (unknown()) {
        if (x == 1)
            x = 2;
        else if (x == 2)
            x = 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x <= 8; */
}
```

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

  The loop toggles the value of `x` between 1 and 2 repeatedly, as long as the opaque condition `unknown()` returns true. Because the function `unknown()` is unspecified, the loop condition is non-deterministic from the static analysis perspective; it could either loop infinitely or terminate at any iteration.

  The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, the value of `x` remains bounded and is either 1 or 2 (since it flips between these values). The assertion `x <= 8` seems trivially true because `x` can only ever be 1 or 2, both less than or equal to 8.

- **Loop Structure:**

  - Loop condition: `while (unknown())`. The condition is unknown and could be arbitrarily true or false.
  - Loop body:
    - If `x` is 1, set `x = 2`.
    - Else if `x` is 2, set `x = 1`.
    - No other changes to `x` or other variables.
  - Variable tracking: Only `x` matters here, initially constrained by the precondition to be 1 or 2.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Since `unknown()` is opaque, we do not know the exact number of iterations. We simulate the samples conceptually:

| Iteration | x value before iteration | x value after iteration |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Pre-loop  | x ∈ {1, 2}              | n/a                    |
| 1         | 1 or 2                  | toggled to 2 if 1, or 1 if 2 |
| 2         | toggled value           | toggled again          |
| 3         | toggled value           | toggled again          |
| 4         | toggled value           | toggled again          |
| 5         | toggled value           | toggled again          |

- `x` alternates between 1 and 2 at every iteration.

- If `x` started at 1: sequence is 1 (start) → 2 (after 1st iteration) →1 → 2 → 1 → 2 ...

- If `x` started at 2: sequence is 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 1 ...

- The loop may terminate any time due to `unknown()`.

- After loop termination, `x` is either 1 or 2.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification goal (post-condition):**

  ```
  assert x <= 8;
  ```

- **Can the verification goal be used as part of the loop invariant?**

  - **No** — Because while `x <= 8` is trivially true throughout (given `x` is only 1 or 2), this condition is too weak and not informative. It neither restricts behavior meaningfully nor helps prove anything stronger about `x`.

- **Modifying the verification goal for a valid invariant:**

  The useful fact shown by the loop behavior is that `x` always equals 1 or 2, given initial precondition and the loop body toggling between those two values.

  Thus, the invariant can be strengthened to:

  ```
  x == 1 || x == 2
  ```

  This invariant:

  - Establishment: True before the loop (by precondition).

  - Preservation: The loop body only toggles between 1 and 2.

  - Termination: On loop exit, `x` is 1 or 2, which implies `x <= 8`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed loop invariant in natural language:**

  *At the start and end of every loop iteration, the variable `x` is always either 1 or 2.*

- **Why is this valid?**

  - The precondition enforces `x` is initially 1 or 2.

  - The loop body only toggles `x` between 1 and 2, so it cannot take any other value.

  - Since toggling only flips `x` between these two values, it’s maintained at every iteration.

---

## e. Establishment

- The given precondition `requires x == 1 || x == 2;` matches exactly the proposed invariant.

- Therefore, the invariant `x == 1 || x == 2` holds before the first loop iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

Assume the invariant holds at the start of a loop iteration (i.e., before entering the body), and the loop condition (`unknown()`) is true so the body executes:

- If `x == 1`: The body sets `x = 2`.

- If `x == 2`: The body sets `x = 1`.

- In both cases, after the body executes, `x` is still either 1 or 2.

Therefore, the invariant is preserved at the end of each loop iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- When the loop terminates, i.e., when `unknown()` returns false, the last state of `x` still satisfies the invariant `x == 1 || x == 2`.

- Since the invariant holds at the end of every iteration and no other modifications to `x` happen outside the loop, the invariant remains true upon termination.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluate the assertion:** `assert x <= 8;`

- Given that the invariant guarantees `x` is always 1 or 2, both of which are less than or equal to 8, the assertion is correct.

- More formally, `(x == 1 || x == 2) => (x <= 8)`.

- Since the invariant holds on loop termination, and the loop terminates only when `unknown()` is false, the post-condition is satisfied due to the invariant combined with loop exit condition.

---

# **Summary / Final Formal Annotations**

```c
/*@ requires x == 1 || x == 2; */

/*@
  loop invariant x == 1 || x == 2;
  ensures x == 1 || x == 2;
*/
void foo229(int x) {
    while (unknown()) {
        if (x == 1)
            x = 2;
        else if (x == 2)
            x = 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x <= 8; */
}
```

- The loop invariant expresses the maintained property of `x` toggling between 1 and 2.

- This invariant is established by the precondition, preserved by the loop body, and holds on loop termination, which in turn guarantees the final assertion.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) == 2 && x == \at(x,Pre) || \at(x,Pre) == 1 && x == \at(x,Pre)`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x == 1 || x == 2;
    */
    
void foo229(int x) {



    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          PLACE_HOLDER_LOOP
            */
            while (unknown()) {
       if(x == 1)
       x = 2;
       else if(x == 2)
       x = 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert x <= 8; */

  }`

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.

- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.
