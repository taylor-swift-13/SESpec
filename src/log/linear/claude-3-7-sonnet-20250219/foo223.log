### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
The loop repeatedly increments the variable `x` by 2 as long as `unknown()` returns true. The goal appears to be to accumulate `x` in steps of 2 potentially an unknown number of times, depending on the loop condition. The final assertion ensures that `x` must be even when the loop finishes.

**Loop Structure:**  
- Governing condition: `while(unknown())` meaning the loop continues while the `unknown()` function returns a true (non-zero) value. The exact nature of `unknown()` is unspecified, but we know only that it controls the loop iterations nondeterministically.
- Loop body: Single operation `x = x + 2;` increases `x` by 2 each iteration.
- Relevant variables:  
  - `x`: an integer initialized to 0, updated by +2 at every iteration.
  - `unknown()`: external function acting as loop guard; unknown side effects or return pattern.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Because `unknown()` is unknown, consider nondeterministic possible executions:

| Iteration        |  x before iteration  |  x after iteration  | Loop condition true?  |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Pre-Loop (0)     | 0                    | -                  | unknown() must be true to enter loop |
| After 1st loop   | 0                    | 2                  | True                  |
| After 2nd loop   | 2                    | 4                  | True                  |
| After 3rd loop   | 4                    | 6                  | True                  |
| After 4th loop   | 6                    | 8                  | True                  |
| After 5th loop   | 8                    | 10                 | True or False (unknown)|
| Post-Loop Exit   | last x before exit   | last x (always even)| False (loop ends)     |

**Key observations:**  
- `x` starts at 0 (even).
- Each iteration adds 2, so `x` remains even after each iteration.
- Loop may terminate after any number of iterations.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
`x % 2 == 0` — `x` is even when the loop terminates.

**Can the post-condition be an invariant?**  
- Yes, it can **directly** be used as a loop invariant here because:  
  - `x` starts at 0 which is even (established before loop).  
  - Each loop iteration adds 2 to `x` which preserves evenness (preserved).  
  - The invariant (`x % 2 == 0`) holds after each iteration and at termination.

No need to modify the post-condition for this example.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant in natural language:**  
“At the start of every loop iteration, the variable `x` is an even integer.”

**Why is this invariant valid?**  
- Initialization: `x` is initialized to 0, which is even.  
- Increment step: Adding 2 to an even number results in another even number.  
- Thus, starting even and adding 2 guarantees `x` remains even at every iteration start and end.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the first iteration, `x = 0`.  
- Because 0 mod 2 = 0, the invariant `x % 2 == 0` holds initially.  
- So establishment condition is satisfied.

---

### f. Preservation

- Assume the invariant holds at the start of some iteration i; i.e. `x` is even.  
- The loop body executes: `x = x + 2`.  
- Since even + 2 = even, `x` remains even after the iteration.  
- Thus, the invariant is preserved at the end of every iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false. At that moment:  
  - The invariant states `x` is even.  
- Since we know from the invariant that `x % 2 == 0` at loop end, the state of `x` when the loop terminates is guaranteed to be even.  
- The invariant remains valid on termination, fulfilling the necessary property for correctness.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- The provided post-condition assertion `x % 2 == 0` is **correct**.  
- The established loop invariant:  
  - `x` is even before each iteration,  
  - remains even after each iteration,  
  - and persists after the loop ends.  
- Because the loop termination condition does not affect the parity of `x`, the invariant combined with loop termination (`!unknown()`) implies the post-condition.  
- Therefore, the post-condition correctly captures the expected property after the loop.

---

### Summary of the loop invariant and its justification:

```c
/*@
  loop invariant x % 2 == 0;
@*/
while(unknown()) {
    x = x + 2;
}
```

- It’s established by initialization `x = 0`.
- Adding 2 preserves evenness.
- It implies post-condition upon loop termination.
