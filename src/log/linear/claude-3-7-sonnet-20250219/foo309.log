---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**  
This loop iterates from `l = 0` to `l = n - 1` and classifies each integer `l` into exactly one of five mutually exclusive categories, incrementing corresponding counters:  
- `v3`: count of numbers divisible by 5  
- `v4`: count of numbers divisible by 4 but not by 5  
- `i`: count of numbers divisible by 3 but not by 4 or 5  
- `j`: count of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3, 4, or 5  
- `k`: count of numbers not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 5  

At the end, these counters collectively count how many numbers in `[0, n)` fall into each of these categories.

**Structure:**  
- The loop condition is `while (l < n)`: the loop iterates `l` from `0` up to `n-1`.  
- Inside the loop body, the value of `l` is tested against divisibility conditions in the order: 5, 4, 3, 2, else.  
- Exactly one counter is incremented per iteration, then `l` is incremented by 1.  
- The counters `i, j, k, v4, v3` track counts of numbers seen matching each condition so far.

Relevant variables:  
- Loop counter: `l` (initially 0, incremented each iteration, up to `n`)  
- Counters: `i, j, k, v4, v3` (all initialized to 0)  
- Input: `n` (non-negative integer <= 20,000,001)

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We sample the variables at specific points:

| Iteration | l | v3 (div 5) | v4 (div 4/!5) | i (div 3/!4/5) | j (div 2/!3/4/5) | k (else) |
|-----------|---|------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Pre-loop  | 0 | 0          | 0             | 0              | 0                | 0        |
| After 1   | 1 | 1          | 0             | 0              | 0                | 0        | 
| After 2   | 2 | 1          | 0             | 0              | 1                | 0        |
| After 3   | 3 | 1          | 0             | 1              | 1                | 0        |
| After 4   | 4 | 1          | 1             | 1              | 1                | 0        |
| After 5   | 5 | 2          | 1             | 1              | 1                | 0        |

**Explanation:**  
- At `l = 0`, 0 % 5 == 0 → increment `v3` (though loop hasn't run yet, counters are zero initially).  
- Iteration 1 (`l = 0`): `v3` increments to 1  
- Iteration 2 (`l = 1`): `1 % 5 != 0, 1 % 4 != 0, 1 % 3 != 0, 1 % 2 != 0` → else → `k` increments → 1  
  Wait, the table above says `k` is 0 after iteration 1, need to re-check.

Actually, `l` starts at 0, then body executes:  
- `l=0`: divisible by 5 → `v3=1`  
- increment `l=1`  
- `l=1`: fails all divisibility → `k=1`  
- increment `l=2`  
- `l=2`: divisible by 2 → `j=1`  
- increment `l=3`  
- `l=3`: divisible by 3 → `i=1`  
- increment `l=4`  
- `l=4`: divisible by 4 → `v4=1`  
- increment `l=5`  
- `l=5`: divisible by 5 → `v3=2`  

So corrected samples:

| Iteration | l after iteration | v3 | v4 | i | j | k |
|-----------|-------------------|----|----|---|---|---|
| Pre-loop  | 0                 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| After 1   | 1                 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| After 2   | 2                 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| After 3   | 3                 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| After 4   | 4                 | 1  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| After 5   | 5                 | 2  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 1 |

(Wait, the `i` counter should be incremented at `l=3` but above it remains 0.)

Fixing that properly:

Detailed iteration by iteration:

- Iter 0 (`l=0`):
  - Divisible by 5 → `v3=1`, others 0
  - `l=1`
- Iter 1 (`l=1`):
  - Divisions fail all → `k=1`
  - `l=2`
- Iter 2 (`l=2`):
  - Divisible by 2 → `j=1`
  - `l=3`
- Iter 3 (`l=3`):
  - Divisible by 3 → `i=1`
  - `l=4`
- Iter 4 (`l=4`):
  - Divisible by 4 → `v4=1`
  - `l=5`
- Iter 5 (`l=5`):
  - Divisible by 5 → `v3=2`
  - `l=6`

So final summary:

| Iteration | l after iteration | v3 | v4 | i | j | k |
|-----------|-------------------|----|----|---|---|---|
| Pre-loop  | 0                 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| After 1   | 1                 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| After 2   | 2                 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| After 3   | 3                 | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| After 4   | 4                 | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| After 5   | 5                 | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Note:** On iteration 4 body (`l=4`), the `v4` counter increments, on iteration 3 body (`l=3`), `i` increments, etc.

This clarifies values after each iteration of the body.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Given post-condition:**  
```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3); */
```

This asserts that the sum of counts is nonzero — but this is a tautology: the sum is unsigned integers being added, so this assertion is superficially trivial (it asserts a nonzero value, but this does not express a concrete property; likely the original intent is missing wording — possibly the user intended to assert that the sum of the counters is exactly the number of iterations completed).

Assuming the intention is to verify:

> At loop termination, the counters `i, j, k, v4, v3` sum exactly to `n`.

Or expressed as:

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n); */
```

which matches the expected result as each number in `[0, n)` is placed into exactly one bucket.

**Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

- If the post-condition is **`(i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n)`**:
  - No, this cannot be the loop invariant as-is because before the first iteration, all counters are zero, and `n` may be positive, so the equality does not hold then.
  - But the _partial sum_ of counters corresponds exactly to how many iterations (i.e., how many values of `l`) have been processed so far, which suggests an invariant relating the sum of counters to `l` itself.

**Modified invariant candidate:**  
```c
i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l
```

- Before the first iteration, `l = 0` and all counters zero → invariant holds.  
- Each iteration increments exactly one counter and increments `l` by 1, preserving equality.  
- When loop terminates, `l == n` by loop condition negation → therefore `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n` holds.

Thus, the verification goal can be reformulated to a valid loop invariant by relating the counters sum to `l`, the loop counter.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (in natural language):**

> At the start of each iteration, the sum of all counters `i, j, k, v4, v3` exactly counts how many numbers `l` in `[0, l)` have been categorized according to the divisibility rules in the loop.

**More formally:**

```c
/*@ invariant 0 <= l <= n && i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l;
    invariant counters are non-negative;
    invariant counters reflect counts of numbers in [0, l) grouped by divisibility;
*/
```

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Before the loop starts, `l=0` and all counters are 0 → sums equal `l=0`.  
- Each iteration processes one distinct `l` and increments the counter corresponding to that `l`'s category → so after the iteration, the sum increments by 1, matching the increment of `l`.  
- Loop condition guarantees `l <= n`.  
- This invariant relates the counters' sum tightly with the progress through `n`.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the loop begins, the code explicitly initializes `l = 0` and `i = j = k = v4 = v3 = 0`.  
- Therefore, `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == 0 == l`.  
- The `requires n <= 20000001` precondition ensures `n` is non-negative and manageable in range.  
- Thus, the invariant holds trivially before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

Suppose **at the start of an iteration**, the invariant holds:  
`i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l` and `l < n`.

In the loop body:

- The code tests `l`'s divisibility and increments exactly one of the counters by one.  
- Then increments `l` by one.  
- Therefore, after executing loop body:  
```c
(i + j + k + v4 + v3)_after = (i + j + k + v4 + v3)_before + 1  
l_after = l_before + 1
```

Hence:  
`(i + j + k + v4 + v3)_after == l_after`.

This shows the invariant is preserved across the iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when the loop condition is false:  
`!(l < n)` → `l >= n`.

Since `l` only increments by 1 and starts at 0, and condition requires `l <= n` in invariants, at termination:  
`l == n`.

By invariant:  
`i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l`, so at termination:  
`i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n`.

This means all `n` integers have been categorized exactly once.

Thus, the invariant remains valid under termination conditions.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Provided post-condition:**  
```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3); */
```

- This post-condition as stated only asserts the sum is "truthy" (nonzero), which is weak and likely an incomplete user assertion.  
- The likely intended post-condition is:  
```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n); */
```
  
**Is this correct?**

- Yes, because each number from 0 to n-1 is classified exactly once in the loop, the sum of counters equals `n`.  

**How does the invariant prove this?**

- Loop invariant enforces `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l` always during looping.  
- At termination, `l == n`  
- Therefore, at loop exit, `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n` holds.

This satisfies and proves the post-condition.

## Summary: Full Loop Analysis

```c
/*@ requires n <= 20000001; */
/*@ ensures i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n; */
void foo309(unsigned int n) {
    unsigned int j, i, k, v4, v3, l;
    i = 0; k = 0; j = 0; l = 0; v4 = 0; v3 = 0;

    /*@ loop invariant 0 <= l <= n;
        loop invariant i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l;
        loop invariant i >= 0 && j >= 0 && k >= 0 && v4 >= 0 && v3 >= 0;
    */
    while (l < n) {
        if ((l % 5) == 0){
            v3 = v3 + 1;
        } else if ((l % 4) == 0) {
            v4 = v4 + 1;
        } else if((l % 3) == 0){
            i = i + 1;
        } else if((l % 2) == 0){
            j = j + 1;
        } else {
            k = k + 1;
        }
        l = l + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n); */
}
```

- This invariant is established by initialization.  
- Preserved by exactly one counter increment plus `l++`.  
- At termination, loop stops at `l == n`, so counters sum equals `n` exactly.  
- The invariant combined with loop termination implies the post-condition.

2025-12-23 05:24:03,256 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 05:26:47,967 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Let’s analyze the given C code and loop in detail, following your requested structure:

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop iterates over all integers from `0` up to, but not including, `n`. On each iteration indexed by `l`:

- It categorizes `l` into one of five mutually exclusive buckets depending on divisibility:
  - `l % 5 == 0`: increment `v3`
  - else if `l % 4 == 0`: increment `v4`
  - else if `l % 3 == 0`: increment `i`
  - else if `l % 2 == 0`: increment `j`
  - else increment `k`
  
The purpose is to count, for all integers less than `n`, how many fall into each of those categories based on the divisibility hierarchy defined.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Governing condition:** `while (l < n)`. The loop iterates as long as the variable `l` is less than `n`.
- **Variables involved:**
  - Loop index: `unsigned int l` — tracks the current iteration number from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
  - Counters: `i, j, k, v4, v3` — all initialized to zero before the loop.
    - `v3` counts elements divisible by 5
    - `v4` counts elements divisible by 4 but not by 5
    - `i` counts elements divisible by 3 but neither by 4 nor by 5
    - `j` counts elements divisible by 2 but not by 3, 4, or 5
    - `k` counts elements not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 5
- **Loop body:** Checks divisibility conditions on `l` in a prioritized order and increments exactly one counter. The index `l` increases by 1 on each iteration.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Initial values before the loop starts (Pre-loop):

```
i = 0; j = 0; k = 0; v4 = 0; v3 = 0; l = 0;
```

---

Iteration by iteration samples:

- **Iteration 1 (l=0) (post iteration):**
  - `l % 5 == 0` holds (0 % 5 == 0)
  - `v3 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `l = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Other counters unchanged.
  
State: `i=0, j=0, k=0, v4=0, v3=1, l=1`

---

- **Iteration 2 (l=1) (post iteration):**
  - `1 % 5 != 0, 1 % 4 != 0, 1 % 3 != 0, 1 % 2 != 0` → else branch increments `k`
  - `k = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `l = 1 + 1 = 2`

State: `i=0, j=0, k=1, v4=0, v3=1, l=2`

---

- **Iteration 3 (l=2) (post iteration):**
  - `2 % 5 != 0, 2 % 4 != 0, 2 % 3 != 0, 2 % 2 == 0` → increment `j`
  - `j = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `l = 2 + 1 = 3`

State: `i=0, j=1, k=1, v4=0, v3=1, l=3`

---

- **Iteration 4 (l=3) (post iteration):**
  - `3 % 5 != 0, 3 % 4 != 0, 3 % 3 == 0` → increment `i`
  - `i = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `l = 3 + 1 = 4`

State: `i=1, j=1, k=1, v4=0, v3=1, l=4`

---

- **Iteration 5 (l=4) (post iteration):**
  - `4 % 5 != 0, 4 % 4 == 0` → increment `v4`
  - `v4 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `l = 4 + 1 = 5`

State: `i=1, j=1, k=1, v4=1, v3=1, l=5`

---

**No termination occurred within these 5 iterations unless `n <= 5`.**

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal / post-condition:**

```c
/*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3); */
```

There is no explicit relational post-condition here, but assuming the comment's intent: The sum of all counters equals `n`.

This is a crucial post-condition because exactly one counter increments per loop iteration, and the loop runs `n` times.

---

**Can this verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

- *No*, the total sum `(i + j + k + v4 + v3)` equals `l` at any point during the loop, since each iteration increments exactly one counter and advances `l` by 1.

- The final post-condition `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n` only holds after the loop terminates (when `l == n`).

- However, a closely related invariant is:

> At the start/end of any iteration, `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l`.

This is stronger and holds *during* loop execution.

---

**Modification to create a valid loop invariant:**

- Use `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l` as the invariant.

- This is:

  - *Established* before the first iteration: All counters and `l` are zero
  - *Preserved* each iteration: One of the counters increments as `l` increments
  - *Termination*: When loop condition `l < n` is false, `l == n` and the invariant implies the post-condition.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (in natural language):**

> At the beginning and end of every loop iteration, the sum of the counters (`i + j + k + v4 + v3`) is equal to the current loop index `l`. In other words, the counters together account exactly for all numbers from 0 up to `l - 1`.

**Why is this valid?**

- The loop only increments one counter per iteration and increments `l` exactly once per iteration, so the total count of categorized elements always matches the current position in the iteration.
- The sum of categories correctly partitions all elements from 0 (inclusive) up to `l` (exclusive).
- The counters are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories based on divisibility rules.
- The invariant holds before entering the loop (all zero), and after every iteration.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the first iteration, `l = 0` and all counters are `0`.
- Therefore, `i + j + k + v4 + v3 = 0 = l` → invariant holds.
- Given pre-condition `n <= 20000001` does not restrict zero or positive `n`, so safe to assume starting state established.

---

### f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at start of iteration: `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l`.
- In the iteration body:
  - One of the counters is incremented depending on divisibility.
  - After that, `l` is incremented by 1.
- So at end of iteration:

  ```
  (i + j + k + v4 + v3) == old l + 1
  l == old l + 1
  ```

- Hence, the sum equals the updated `l`, preserving the invariant.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `l < n` is false, i.e. `l >= n`.
- Given the loop only increments `l` by 1 starting at 0 and looping while `l < n`, termination occurs at `l == n`.
- At termination:

  ```
  i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l == n
  ```

- The invariant still holds, now relating sums of counters to total `n`.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- The asserted post-condition (though syntactically incomplete in the snippet) presumably is:

  ```c
  //@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n);
  ```

- This is **correct** given the loop behavior and invariant.

- From the invariant and termination condition:

  ```
  Invariant: i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l
  Termination: l == n
  ```
  
- Combining:

  ```
  i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n
  ```

- Thus, the counters collectively count exactly the `n` iterations, validating the post-condition.

---

# **Summary of Formal Loop Invariant and Verification Analysis**

```c
/*@
    loop invariant 0 <= l <= n;
    loop invariant i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l;
    loop invariant i, j, k, v4, v3 >= 0;  // counters are never negative
@*/
while (l < n) {
    // loop body unchanged
}
```

- The loop invariant states that the sum of counters equals the number of iterations completed.
- It's established initially (all zero).
- Preserved on each iteration by incrementing exactly one counter and `l`.
- At termination, combined with `l == n`, it proves the post-condition.

2025-12-23 05:27:08,353 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this code, I need to generate loop invariants that will help prove the post-condition `assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3)`.

Based on my analysis:

1. The loop counts how many numbers from 0 to n-1 fall into each divisibility category
2. Each iteration increments exactly one counter and increments `l` by 1
3. The key invariant is that the sum of all counters equals `l` at any point
4. When the loop terminates (`l == n`), the sum equals `n`

The post-condition assertion `(i + j + k + v4 + v3)` in C is checking if the sum is non-zero (truthy), but given the context and the requirement to prove it, this likely intends to verify that `i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n`.

Here's the complete code with loop invariants:

```c
/*@
    requires n <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo309(unsigned int n) {

    unsigned
    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int k;
    unsigned int v4;
    unsigned int v3;
    unsigned int l;

    i = 0;
    k = 0;
    j = 0;
    l = 0;
    v4 = 0;
    v3 = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant 0 <= l <= n;
          loop invariant i + j + k + v4 + v3 == l;
          loop invariant (!(l < n)) ==> (i + j + k + v4 + v3 == n);
          loop assigns l, i, j, k, v4, v3;
            */
            while (l < n) {
       if ((l % 5) == 0){
       v3 = v3 + 1;
      }
       else if ((l % 4) == 0) {
       v4 = v4 + 1;
      }
       else if((l % 3) == 0){
       i = i + 1;
      }
       else if((l % 2) == 0){
       j = j + 1;
      }
       else{
       k = k + 1;
      }
       l = l + 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert (i + j + k + v4 + v3); */

  }
```
