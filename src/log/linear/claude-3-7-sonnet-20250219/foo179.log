---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

The loop iterates from `x = 0` up to `x < n` (where `n > 0`). During each iteration, it conditionally updates the variable `m` to the current value of `x` if the `unknown()` function returns true. The goal appears to be to set `m` to some value in the range `[0, n-1]` where `unknown()` has returned true at least once. If `unknown()` never returns true, then `m` remains at its initial value 0.

The post-condition being asserted (`(x >= n && n > 0) ==> (0 <= m)`) states that at the end of the loop `m` must be at least 0, which is trivially true since `m` was initialized to 0 and can only be assigned to values of `x` starting from 0.

**Loop Structure:**

- **Condition:** `while(x < n)` — the loop runs while `x` is less than `n`.
- **Variables:** 
    - `x` is the loop index, starting at 0, incremented by 1 each iteration.
    - `m` is updated conditionally.
- **Body:**
    - If `unknown()` returns true, assign `m = x`.
    - Increment `x` by 1 after that.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We perform conceptual sampling of `(x, m)` before the loop and at iterations 1 through 5.

| Iteration | x before itr | unknown() result | m before itr | m after itr | x after itr |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Pre-loop  | 0            | —                | 0            | 0           | 0           |
| 1         | 0            | unknown() unknown| 0            | either 0 or 0 (if unknown()==true, m=0; else m=0) | 1           |
| 2         | 1            | unknown() unknown| (from prev)  | possibly m=1 if unknown()==true, else previous m | 2           |
| 3         | 2            | unknown() unknown| (from prev)  | possibly m=2 if unknown()==true, else previous m | 3           |
| 4         | 3            | unknown() unknown| (from prev)  | possibly m=3 if unknown()==true, else previous m | 4           |
| 5         | 4            | unknown() unknown| (from prev)  | possibly m=4 if unknown()==true, else previous m | 5           |

- At each iteration `x` increases by 1.
- `m` either retains its previous value or updates to the current `x`.
- Since `m` is initialized to 0, it never takes a negative value.
- Loop terminates once `x == n`.

If `n < 5`, the loop ends earlier and variables settle at those values.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**

```c
/*@ assert (x >= n && n > 0) ==> (0 <= m); */
```

The verification goal states: once loop ends (`x >= n`), and input precondition `n > 0` holds, then `m` is non-negative.

- **Can it be used as an invariant?**

No. The post-condition requires `x >= n`, which by definition is false during any iteration inside the loop (loop runs while `x < n`). Therefore, the goal cannot serve directly as a loop invariant, since it includes loop termination state.

- **Modification for invariant:**

We want an invariant that holds throughout the loop, including before the first iteration, and connects to this goal at termination.

Since `m` is initialized to 0 and only updates to some `x` (always ≥ 0), an invariant candidate could be:

```c
0 <= m <= x
```

This says `m` is always between 0 and the current `x`.

- This holds before loop begins (since `m=0` and `x=0`).
- If true at beginning of iteration and `x < n`, it will remain true after iteration.
- At termination (`x >= n`), this implies `0 <= m`, satisfying the post-condition.

Thus, the modified invariant `0 <= m <= x` is suitable.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

At the beginning and end of every iteration of the loop, the value `m` is a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to the current loop index `x`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- Since `m` is initialized as 0, and `x` initially 0, initially `0 <= m <= x` holds.
- Inside the loop, whenever `unknown()` returns true, `m` is assigned the current `x`. Since `x` is always ≥ 0, `m` remains ≥ 0.
- When `unknown()` returns false, `m` remains unchanged, so its previous relationship still holds.
- `x` increments by 1 each cycle, so `x` always increases or remains equal to any previously set `m`. 
- Hence, `m <= x` is maintained.
  
This invariant captures the safe range of `m` relative to `x`.

---

### e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established:**

- **Initial values:** `x = 0`, `m = 0` before the first iteration.
- Therefore, `0 <= m` is true (since `m=0`).
- Also, `m <= x` since both are 0.
- The pre-condition guarantees `n > 0` so the loop is guaranteed to have at least one iteration but this doesn't affect the base establishment.
  
Thus, before loop starts, `0 <= m <= x` holds.

---

### f. Preservation

Suppose at the beginning of the iteration, the invariant `0 <= m <= x` holds, and loop condition `x < n` is true.

- Case 1: `unknown()` returns true
  - `m = x`
  - Since `x` is ≥ 0 (due to initialization and increments)
  - So `m` becomes exactly `x`.
- Case 2: `unknown()` returns false
  - `m` remains unchanged.
  - Since previously `m <= x`, and `x` will be incremented after.
  
After executing the assignment (or not) depending on `unknown()`, the increment `x = x + 1` is performed.

Now check the invariant at end of iteration:

- `0 <= m` is true because:
  - Either `m = x` where `x >= 0`
  - Or `m` unchanged and was ≥ 0 previously.
- `m <= x` is true because:
  - If `m = x` before increment, after `x = x + 1`, now `m = (x - 1) < x`, so `m <= x`
  - If `m` unchanged and previously `m <= x` before increment, then `m <= x - 1 < x`.
  
So after increment, `m <= x` still holds.

Therefore, invariant is preserved.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**Loop terminates:** when `x < n` becomes false → `x >= n`.

At termination:

- The invariant `0 <= m <= x` holds.
- Since `x >= n` and `n > 0` (from pre-condition), at termination:
  - `m` is still ≥ 0.
- The assertion states `(x >= n && n > 0) ==> (0 <= m)` which is therefore true due to invariant and final state.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The asserted post-condition is:

```c
(x >= n && n > 0) ==> (0 <= m);
```

- This post-condition is **correct** but almost trivially so, because `m` was initialized to 0 and only ever set to values ≥ 0.
- The invariant `0 <= m <= x` together with termination `x >= n` immediately implies `0 <= m`.
- Hence, the loop invariant and final condition entail the post-condition.

---

## Summary:

**Loop Invariant (formal):**

```c
/*@
  loop invariant 0 <= m <= x;
@*/
while (x < n) {
    if(unknown()) {
        m = x;
    }
    x = x + 1;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Established before loop because `m=0` and `x=0`.
- Preserved on every iteration due to the conditional update and loop increment.
- Termination condition (`x >= n`) combined with the invariant implies the post-condition.
- The invariant tightly captures the range of `m` relative to the progress variable `x`, ensuring the assertion holds.

2025-12-23 00:04:33,745 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (m == 0) * (x == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */
    
void foo179(int n) {

    int x;
    int m;

    x = 0;
    m = 0;

          loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (((m == 0)&&(x == 0)&&(n == \at(n,Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_m));
          loop invariant (!(0 < \at(n,Pre))) ==> ((m == 0)&&(x == 0)&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);

            while(x < n){

2025-12-23 00:04:50,897 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this problem, I need to fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants based on the analysis from the previous conversation.

Let me analyze what needs to be filled:

1. `PLACE_HOLDER_x`: This should describe the bounds on `x` during the loop
2. `PLACE_HOLDER_m`: This should describe the relationship of `m` when we're past the initial state
3. `PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS`: Variables modified by the loop

From the analysis:
- `x` ranges from 0 to n: `0 <= x <= n`
- `m` ranges from 0 to x: `0 <= m <= x`
- The loop modifies `x` and `m`

The second invariant has a special structure with an OR condition to handle the initial state versus subsequent states. When `x > 0`, we're past the initial state and need `0 <= m <= x`.

```c
/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */
    
void foo179(int n) {

    int x;
    int m;

    x = 0;
    m = 0;
