---

### Code Under Analysis

```c
void foo235() {
    unsigned int x;
    x = 268435441;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */
    while (x > 1) {
        x -= 2;
    }

    /*@ assert x % 2 == 1; */
}
```

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
The loop repeatedly decreases the value of the unsigned integer variable `x` by 2 as long as `x` remains greater than 1. The intended outcome is to reduce `x` down to a value less than or equal to 1 by decrementing it successively by 2. Because `x` starts at an odd value (268,435,441), repeatedly subtracting 2 preserves the parity of `x`. After the loop ends, `x` will be either 1 or 0, depending on how the subtraction proceeds.

**Loop Structure:**  
- **Governing condition:** `while (x > 1)`  
- **Loop body:** `x -= 2;` (decrement `x` by 2 each iteration)  
- **Relevant variables:** Only `x` affects the loop and its condition.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Initial value (pre-loop):**  
- `x = 268,435,441`

**After each loop iteration:**  
- Iteration 1: `x = 268,435,441 - 2 = 268,435,439`  
- Iteration 2: `x = 268,435,439 - 2 = 268,435,437`  
- Iteration 3: `x = 268,435,437 - 2 = 268,435,435`  
- Iteration 4: `x = 268,435,435 - 2 = 268,435,433`  
- Iteration 5: `x = 268,435,433 - 2 = 268,435,431`

Each iteration reduces `x` by 2, preserving that `x` remains odd.

**Post-loop termination:**  
The loop ends when `x <= 1`. Since `x` decrements by 2 from an odd number, the possible terminating values are `x == 1` or `x == 0`. However, since `x` starts odd and subtracts 2 (an even number) repeatedly, `x` will remain odd. Therefore, the loop will terminate at `x = 1`.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Post-condition to verify:**  
`x % 2 == 1` (i.e., `x` is odd at loop termination).

**Can the post-condition be part of the loop invariant?**  
- **NO**, it cannot be directly part of the invariant as is, because while it is true initially and after every iteration, it only makes sense to assert at termination combined with the loop condition.

**Explanation:**  
- The post-condition states that `x` is odd when the loop terminates.  
- The invariant should hold during all iterations.  
- The parity (oddness) of `x` is preserved through all iterations of the loop (since subtracting 2 does not change parity).  
- Therefore, the parity condition (`x % 2 == 1`) can be elevated to an invariant because it holds initially and is preserved by the loop body.

Hence, *actually*, the post-condition is **indeed an invariant** because:

- It holds before the first iteration (initial `x` is odd).  
- Subtracting 2 from an odd number results in an odd number.  
- So, parity remains odd throughout the loop execution, including at termination.

No modification is necessary; we can use `x % 2 == 1` as a loop invariant.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**  
"At the start and end of every iteration of the loop, `x` is a positive odd integer greater than or equal to 1."

**Explanation:**  
- Initially, `x` is set to 268,435,441 (which is odd and >1).  
- The loop decrements `x` by 2 each time, preserving its oddness.  
- The loop condition `x > 1` ensures `x` stays at least 3 during loop iterations.  
- Eventually, when `x` reaches 1, the loop terminates.  
- Throughout all these states, `x` remains an odd positive integer ≥ 1.

This invariant succinctly summarizes the properties preserved by the loop, capturing parity, positivity, and domain constraints.

---

### e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established:**  
- Before the first loop iteration, `x` is explicitly initialized to 268,435,441, which is odd (`268,435,441 % 2 == 1`) and greater than 1.  
- Therefore, the invariant holds before entering the loop.

---

### f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved:**  
- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, so `x` is odd and greater than 1.  
- The loop condition `x > 1` is true, so the body runs: `x -= 2`.  
- Subtracting 2 from an odd number results in another odd number (`odd - even = odd`).  
- Since `x` was > 1, after subtracting 2, `x` remains ≥ 1 (because the loop exits if `x` would drop below or equal to 1).  
- Thus, the invariant — `x` is odd and ≥ 1 — continues to hold at the end of the iteration.  
- The invariant is preserved.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**State on termination:**  
- The loop terminates when `x > 1` is false, that is, when `x <= 1`.  
- Given the invariant ensures `x` is odd and positive during the loop, the only feasible terminating value is `x == 1`.  
- At termination, `x` is `1`, which is odd.

**Invariant validity at termination:**  
- The invariant states `x` is odd and ≥ 1, which is true at termination when `x == 1`.  
- Therefore, the invariant stays true even when the loop condition is false.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Is the post-condition correct?**  
- Yes, the post-condition `x % 2 == 1` is correct.

**Explanation:**  
- The loop invariant ensures `x` is always odd throughout the execution.  
- The loop terminates when `x` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `x == 1`.  
- At termination, combining the invariant (`x` odd) with negation of loop condition (`x <= 1`) implies `x == 1`.  
- Since `1 % 2 == 1`, the post-condition holds.

Thus, the post-condition is guaranteed by the loop invariant and termination condition.

---

## Summary of the Loop Invariant

```c
/*@ loop invariant x % 2 == 1 && x >= 1; */
```

- This invariant is established before the loop due to the initial assignment  
- It is preserved because subtracting 2 from an odd number yields another odd number ≥ 1 during looping  
- It holds at loop termination, ensuring the post-condition `x % 2 == 1`
