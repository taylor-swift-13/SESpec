2025-12-23 02:12:16,328 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Here is a detailed formal verification analysis of the given C code snippet and its loop with the requested structure:

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
The loop is intended to count iterations from `i = 1` up to and including `i = size`, while accumulating a count in the variable `sn`. Essentially, the loop increments the index variable `i` and a counter `sn` simultaneously, with `sn` tracking how many times the loop has executed. The likely goal is that after the loop finishes, `sn` equals the number of increments, which should equal `size`.

**Loop Structure:**  
- **Governing Condition:** `while (i <= size)` — the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `size`.  
- **Body Operations:**
  - `i = i + 1;` — increment the loop variable `i` by one each iteration.
  - `sn = sn + 1;` — increment the counter `sn` by one each iteration.  
- **Relevant Variables:**  
  - `i` — loop index, initialized to 1.  
  - `sn` — iteration counter, initialized to 0.  
  - `size` — maximum index value, input parameter, assumed ≥ 0 for meaningful loop execution.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Iteration | i (before increment) | i (after increment) | sn (after increment) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Before loop starts | 1                    | -                   | 0                    |
| After iteration 1  | 1                    | 2                   | 1                    |
| After iteration 2  | 2                    | 3                   | 2                    |
| After iteration 3  | 3                    | 4                   | 3                    |
| After iteration 4  | 4                    | 5                   | 4                    |
| After iteration 5  | 5                    | 6                   | 5                    |

**Note:** The increment happens at the end of each iteration. The value of `i` before it is incremented at iteration `n` equals `n`. After increment, it becomes `n+1`, and `sn` increases by 1 each time, tracking the number of completed iterations.

**Termination condition:**  
- The loop continues while `i <= size`.  
- The loop terminates when `i` becomes `size + 1` (i.e., when the last increment pushes `i` beyond `size`).  
- At this point:  
  - `i == size + 1`  
  - `sn == size` (the loop has run exactly `size` times).

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Given Post-condition:**  
```c
/*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == size); */
```
This states: If `sn` is not zero, then it must equal `size`.

**Can it serve as a loop invariant directly?**  
- **No.** Because this post-condition is about the state *after* the loop terminates. During the loop, `sn` increments from 0 up to `size`, so it may be neither 0 nor equal to `size`. Before the loop finishes, for example, after 2 iterations, `sn == 2`, but `size` could be any number larger than 2, so `(sn == size)` is false. Therefore, the post-condition is not true during intermediate iterations.

**Can it be modified into a valid loop invariant?**  
- Yes. We want an invariant that relates `sn` and `i` during execution and implies the post-condition at termination.

**Proposed modification:**  
- Maintain the invariant:  
  > At the start and end of each iteration, **sn = i - 1** and **1 ≤ i ≤ size + 1**.

This means the number of loop iterations completed (`sn`) is always exactly one less than the current index `i`.

**Why is this valid?**  
- Before the loop starts, `i = 1`, `sn = 0`, so `sn = i-1` holds.  
- Each iteration increments both by 1, preserving `sn = i-1`.  
- When the loop terminates, `i = size + 1`, so `sn = size`. Therefore, the post-condition `(sn == size)` holds when `sn != 0`. If the loop never executes (`size < 1`), then `sn = 0`.  

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**  
> At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, the variable `sn` is always equal to `i - 1`, where `i` is between 1 and `size + 1` inclusive.

**Explanation:**  
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and `sn = 0`, so `sn = i - 1` holds initially.  
- Each iteration increments `i` by 1 and simultaneously increments `sn` by 1, which keeps `sn = i - 1` true.  
- Since the loop condition is `i <= size`, and `i` increments by 1 every iteration, it reaches `size + 1` when the loop terminates, maintaining the invariant throughout.  

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established before the loop begins?**  
- Initially, before the first iteration: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`.  
- Substitute: `sn == i - 1` → `0 == 1 - 1` → `0 == 0`, which is true.  
- The invariant holds outright at the start, satisfying the establishment condition.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved during each iteration?**

Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration:

- **Inductive hypothesis:** At the start of an iteration, `sn = i - 1`.
- The loop condition `i <= size` holds (otherwise, loop would terminate).
- Loop body executes: 
  - `i = i + 1`  
  - `sn = sn + 1`  
- After execution:
  - New `i` is the old `i + 1`.
  - New `sn` is old `sn + 1`.
- Check invariant after the iteration:

  New `sn = old sn + 1`  
  New `i = old i + 1`  
  Substitute old invariant: `old sn = old i - 1`

  Therefore,  

  New `sn` = `(old i - 1) + 1 = old i`  
  New `i` = `old i + 1`

- Now, check if new `sn = new i - 1`:  
  New `sn` = `old i`  
  New `i - 1` = `(old i + 1) - 1 = old i`  

- So, `new sn = new i - 1` holds after iteration.

This shows preservation of the invariant by the loop body under the loop condition.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**At loop termination:**

- The loop condition `i <= size` is false.
- So, `i > size`.
- The smallest `i` that breaks the condition is `i = size + 1`.
- According to the invariant at loop termination: `sn = i - 1 = (size + 1) - 1 = size`.
- So at termination, `sn == size`.
- Variables relevant at termination:  
  - `i = size + 1`  
  - `sn = size`  

**Why invariant remains valid:**  
- The invariant was preserved at every iteration, so it must hold when the loop exits.
- The fact that `i` exceeded `size` triggers loop exit, and from invariant we get exact `sn` count.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Given Post-condition:**  
```c
/*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == size);*/
```

**Evaluation:**  
- The post-condition states that if `sn` is non-zero, then it equals `size`.  
- Because the loop increments `sn` starting at zero, it can be zero only if the loop did not execute (which happens if `size < 1`).  
- If the loop executes at least once, `sn` increments to track the exact number of iterations it ran, which is `size`.
- Thus, the post-condition is **correct** given the loop invariant and termination.

**Proof:**

- From invariant + loop termination: `sn == size`.
- Therefore, if `sn` is not zero (meaning at least one iteration occurred), it must equal `size`.
- If `sn` is zero, the implication antecedent `(sn != 0)` is false, making the whole assertion true trivially.

---

# **Summary: Formal Loop Invariant and Verification**

```c
/*@ 
  loop_invariant 1 <= i <= size + 1;
  loop_invariant sn == i - 1;
*/
while (i <= size) {
  i = i + 1;
  sn = sn + 1;
}

assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == size);
```

- The invariant `sn == i - 1` fully captures the loop’s behavior and is inductive.
- It is established before the loop, preserved across iterations, and yields the post-condition combined with loop termination.
- The post-condition is correct and follows logically from the invariant.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 02:12:16,354 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(sn == 0) * (i == 1) * (v3 == \at(v3,Pre)) * (v2 == \at(v2,Pre)) * (v1 == \at(v1,Pre)) * (size == \at(size,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo123(int size,int v1,int v2,int v3) {
 
    int i = 1;
    int sn = 0;

- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.
