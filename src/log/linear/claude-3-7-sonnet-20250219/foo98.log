### Given Code

```c
void foo98(int x) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int y = 2;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */
    while (i <= x) {
        i = i + 1;
        j = j + y;
    }

    /*@ assert (i != j) ==> (y != 1) ;*/
}
```

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and intended outcome:**

The loop increments `i` starting from 0 until it surpasses `x`. Simultaneously, it accumulates the value of `y` (which is initialized to 2) into `j` on each iteration. Essentially, `i` counts loop iterations (from 1 up to `x+1`), and `j` sums `y` once per iteration.

**Expected outcome:**

- After the loop finishes, `i` will be `x + 1`.
- `j` will be `y` multiplied by the number of iterations (which is `x + 1`).

**Structure:**

- Loop condition: `i <= x`
- Loop body:
  - `i = i + 1;` — increments the loop counter by 1
  - `j = j + y;` — adds `y` to `j` each iteration
- Variables relevant:
  - `i`: iteration index/counter starting at 0
  - `j`: accumulated sum of `y`
  - `y`: constant increment value 2 that is added to `j` every iteration
  - `x`: input parameter defining loop upper bound

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We start with initial values:

| Step               | i | j | y |
|--------------------|---|---|---|
| Pre-loop (0)       | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| After iteration 1   | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| After iteration 2   | 2 | 4 | 2 |
| After iteration 3   | 3 | 6 | 2 |
| After iteration 4   | 4 | 8 | 2 |
| After iteration 5   | 5 | 10| 2 |

The loop continues as long as `i <= x`. If `x >= 5`, the loop proceeds beyond 5 iterations.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert (i != j) ==> (y != 1) ;*/
```

This asserts: *If at the end of the loop `i` is not equal to `j`, then `y` is not 1.*

**First, can this verification goal be a loop invariant?**

- The goal relates a conditional relation between `i`, `j`, and `y`.
- At loop termination, `i` and `j` accumulate values depending on the loop iteration count and `y`.
- The value of `y` is never modified during the loop—it remains 2.
- During the loop, since `y` is always 2, the relation `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` appears always true.
- However, if we consider the possibility of `y` being 1, then `j` would be equal to `i` since `j += y` each iteration and `y` is 1.
  - Hence `i != j` would be false (they would be equal).
  
Therefore:

- The post-condition is **true at loop termination**.
- It cannot be merely directly used as a loop invariant without modification.
- The post-condition effectively states a property about `y` if `i` and `j` differ, which is true given the addition pattern.

**Modification to create an invariant:**

Observing the variables:

- `j = y * i` always holds during the loop, given initial `j = 0` and `i` starting at 0.
- So a useful invariant can be: 

  ``` 
  j == y * i 
  ```

This equality holds:

- Before the loop starts (both zero).
- After every iteration (`i` increments by 1, `j` increments by `y`).

Then the verification goal can be reframed as:

- If `j != i` then `y != 1`, which follows since `j = y * i`.
- When `y=1`, `j == i`.
- When `y != 1`, `j != i`.

So the invariant to maintain is `j == y * i`.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed valid loop invariant (natural language):**

At the start and end of each loop iteration, the value of `j` equals `y` multiplied by `i`.

Formally:

```c
j == y * i
```

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Before the loop starts: `i = 0`, `j = 0`, so `j == y * i` → `0 == y * 0` → true.
- Each iteration:
  - `i` is incremented by 1
  - `j` is incremented by `y`
- Therefore, after increment:
  - New `j` = old `j` + `y`
  - New `i` = old `i` + 1
- Using the previous invariant (old `j == y * old i`), the new values satisfy:

  ```
  new j = old j + y = y * old i + y = y * (old i + 1) = y * new i
  ```

This confirms the invariant is preserved.

---

### e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established?**

- Initially:

  ```c
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  ```

- At this point:

  ```
  j == y * i
  0 == y * 0
  0 == 0
  ```

- Thus, the invariant holds true before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved during iterations?**

Assuming the invariant holds at the start of the iteration:

```
j == y * i
```

Inside the loop body:

```
i = i + 1;
j = j + y;
```

After these updates:

```
j_new = j + y = y * i + y = y * (i + 1)
i_new = i + 1
```

Hence,

```
j_new == y * i_new
```

Therefore, the invariant holds after the iteration.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

**Loop termination condition:**

```
i <= x
```

The loop terminates the first time

```
i > x
```

At termination:

- `i = x + 1`
- From the invariant, 
  ```
  j = y * i = y * (x + 1)
  ```

The invariant `j == y * i` remains valid.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Given post-condition:**

```c
(i != j) ==> (y != 1);
```

**Evaluate correctness:**

- Since `j = y * i`, the condition `i != j` rewrites as:

  ```
  i != y * i
  => i * (1 - y) != 0
  ```

- If `i` is not zero (which is true after at least one iteration), then:

  ```
  1 - y != 0 → y != 1
  ```

- Therefore, the assertion `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` always holds given the invariant.

- If `y` = 1, then `j = i` (equal), so left side `(i != j)` is false, and the implication is true by vacuous truth.

**How invariant + negation of loop condition proves it:**

- At loop exit, we know `i == x + 1` and `j == y * (x + 1)`.
- If `i != j`, then `y != 1` follows.
- If `y == 1`, then `j == i` and the premise of the implication is false.
- Thus, the assertion holds true in all cases, proving correctness.

|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Loop purpose**   | Counts `i` from 0 to `x+1` while accumulating `j += y` per iteration.                           |
| **Variable values**| `i` increments by 1, `j` increments by `y` each loop, samples reflected this.                    |
| **Verification goal** | `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)` post-condition. Not a pure invariant, but relates via `j == y * i`.   |
| **Loop invariant** | `j == y * i` holds before, during, and after loop iterations.                                   |
| **Establishment**  | Holds initially since `j = 0` and `y * i = y * 0 = 0`.                                          |
| **Preservation**   | Increment updates preserve `j == y * i` relationship on each iteration.                          |
| **Termination**    | Loop ends when `i = x + 1`, invariant remains true at termination.                              |
| **Post-condition correctness** | The assertion always holds due to invariant. If `y = 1` then `i == j`, otherwise `(i != j)` implies `(y != 1)`. |

2025-12-23 02:14:31,664 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(y == 2) * (j == 0) * (i == 0) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo98(int x) {
    int i =0;
    int j =0;
    int y =2;
