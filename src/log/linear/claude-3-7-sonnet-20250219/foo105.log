### Code snippet for reference:

```c
void foo105(int n,int v1,int v2,int v3) {
  
    int x = 0;
    
    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@

    while (x < n) {
        x  = (x + 1);
    }
            
    /*@ assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == n); */
    
}
```

---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**:  
  The loop aims to increment the integer variable `x` starting from 0 until it reaches `n`. At completion, `x` should be equal to `n`, assuming `n` is non-negative. Essentially, this is a simple counting loop with no side effects other than updating `x`.

- **Structure**:  
  - **Loop condition:** `while (x < n)` — the loop continues as long as `x` is strictly less than `n`.
  - **Loop body:** a single statement: `x = x + 1;` increments `x` by one on each iteration.
  - **Relevant variables:**  
    - `x`: loop counter, initialized to 0 before the loop; controls loop progress.  
    - `n`: loop bound, fixed input parameter, assumed to be non-negative for the post-condition.

No other variables (`v1, v2, v3`) affect the loop behavior.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

| Sample Point           | x Value    | Explanation                          |
|-----------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Pre-loop (before 1st) | 0          | `x` is initialized to 0            |
| Post-1st iteration    | 1          | `x` incremented from 0 to 1        |
| Post-2nd iteration    | 2          | `x` incremented to 2                |
| Post-3rd iteration    | 3          | `x` incremented to 3                |
| Post-4th iteration    | 4          | `x` incremented to 4                |
| Post-5th iteration    | 5          | `x` incremented to 5                |
| Post-loop (if n ≤ 5)   | x == n     | Loop stops when `x == n`            |

- This assumes `n` ≥ 0.  
- If `n` < 5, loop terminates earlier, else continues increasing `x` by 1 each time.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**:  
  `(n >= 0) ==> (x == n)`  
  The assertion states: if `n` is non-negative, then after the loop finishes, `x` must equal `n`.

- **Can this be part of the loop invariant?**  
  *No,* it cannot directly be used as the invariant because:  
  - Before the first iteration, `x == 0` but `n` may be larger than 0, so `x == n` is false usually.  
  - During iterations, `x` varies and is generally less than or equal to `n`, but not necessarily equal.

- **Modification to create a valid invariant:**  
  Instead of `x == n`, a property that always holds is:  
  > `0 <= x <= n`

  This invariant states that at any point before or after an iteration, the value of `x` lies between 0 and `n` inclusive.

- **Why this works:**  
  - Establishment: `x` is initialized to 0, which is between 0 and `n` (given `n >= 0`).  
  - Preservation: `x` increments by 1 but does not surpass `n` due to the loop condition.  
  - Termination: When the loop finishes, the only way for the condition `x < n` to fail is if `x >= n`. Coupled with the invariant `x <= n`, we get `x == n`. This implies the post-condition.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed loop invariant (in natural language):**  
  > At the start and end of every iteration, the variable `x` satisfies `0 <= x <= n`.

- **Explanation:**  
  - Initially, `x = 0`, so it's within `[0, n]` for `n >= 0`.  
  - The loop increments `x` by 1 each iteration, but only executes if `x < n`. Thus, the incremented `x` remains less than or equal to `n`.  
  - This guarantees that `x` never goes below 0 or beyond `n` throughout execution.

---

### e. Establishment

- **How the invariant is established:**  
  Before the loop begins, `x` is explicitly initialized to 0. Given the pre-condition `n >= 0`, it follows immediately that:  
  `0 <= x (0) <= n`  
  Thus, the invariant holds trivially before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

- **Invariant preservation during iterations:**  
  Suppose the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `0 <= x <= n` and the loop condition `x < n` is true.  
  - The loop body executes `x = x + 1`.  
  - Since `x < n`, incrementing `x` results in `x_new = x + 1 <= n`.  
  - Also, incrementing does not make `x` negative.  
  Therefore, after the increment, the invariant still holds: `0 <= x_new <= n`.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- **Loop termination condition**: `x < n` is false, i.e., `x >= n`.  
- From the invariant, we also know `x <= n`.  
- Combined: `x >= n` and `x <= n` imply `x == n`.  
- Thus, when the loop terminates, `x == n`.

- The invariant remains valid at termination, and combined with the negation of the loop condition, leads directly to the post-condition.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Given post-condition:** `(n >= 0) ==> (x == n)`  
- **Is it correct?**  
  Yes, assuming `n >= 0`, the post-condition is correct.

- **Proof using invariant and loop termination:**  
  - Invariant: `0 <= x <= n` holds throughout execution.  
  - Loop exit means `x < n` is false => `x >= n`.  
  - From invariant, `x <= n` and termination condition imply `x == n`.  
  - Therefore, upon loop completion, `x == n`, matching the post-condition.

---

## Summary of the Loop Invariant and Verification

**Loop Invariant:**  
```text
0 <= x <= n
```

**Why it works:**  
- Holds before the loop (establishment) because x=0 and n≥0.  
- Maintained by each iteration (preservation) because the loop increments x by 1 only while `x < n`.  
- At termination, combined with the loop exit condition, it implies the post-condition `x == n`.

This invariant allows formal reasoning about the loop progress and proves the correctness of the code snippet's post-condition.

If you want, I can also provide the invariant formally in ACSL or other annotation style for this snippet!

2025-12-22 22:15:14,425 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 0) * (v3 == \at(v3,Pre)) * (v2 == \at(v2,Pre)) * (v1 == \at(v1,Pre)) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo105(int n,int v1,int v2,int v3) {
  
    int x = 0;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
