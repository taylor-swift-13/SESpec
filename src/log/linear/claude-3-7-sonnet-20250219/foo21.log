## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and intended outcome of the loop:**

- The function initializes two variables `x` and `m` to 1.
- The loop iterates as long as `x < n`.
- During each iteration, the `unknown()` function decides nondeterministically whether to update `m` to the current `x` value.
- After that conditional update, `x` is incremented by 1.
- The ultimate effect is that `m` may track some value of `x` encountered during the loop iterations, specifically the value of `x` in some (potentially multiple) iterations where `unknown()` returns true.
- The assertion after the loop states that if `n > 1`, then `m < n`. This means `m` should always remain strictly less than `n`.

**Loop structure:**

- **Loop condition:** `while (x < n)` — the loop runs as long as `x` is less than `n`.
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `x`: loop control variable, starting at 1, incremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `m`: variable updated conditionally inside the loop.
- **Loop body:**
  - Check `unknown()`.
  - If true, update `m = x`.
  - Increment `x`.

So the loop scans from `1` to `n - 1`, with `m` set to certain `x` values when `unknown()` returns true.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Assuming some possible `unknown()` return values nondeterministically, here’s an example sampling pattern from initial to iterations 5:

| Iteration | x (start) | unknown() result | m (before update) | m (after update) | x (after increment) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 0 (pre)   | 1         | N/A              | 1                 | 1                | 1                   |
| 1         | 1         | true             | 1                 | 1 (updated to x=1)| 2                   |
| 2         | 2         | false            | 1                 | 1                | 3                   |
| 3         | 3         | true             | 1                 | 3                | 4                   |
| 4         | 4         | false            | 3                 | 3                | 5                   |
| 5         | 5         | true             | 3                 | 5                | 6                   |

- `x` is the current loop counter at the start of iteration.
- `m` updates to the current `x` only if `unknown()` returns true.
- After incrementing, `x` moves closer to `n`.
- This process continues until `x >= n`.

If `n` = 6 in this example, the loop will terminate once `x` reaches 6, with the final `m` possibly being 5.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
(n > 1) ==> (m < n)
```

In words, if `n` is greater than 1, the variable `m` must be strictly less than `n` after the loop finishes.

**Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

- **No.** Because the post-condition is specifically about the value of `m` when the loop terminates.
- During iterations, `m` is updated to some values less than `n`, but it may also be equal to `x` which is always less than `n` inside the loop.
- However, before the loop starts, `m = 1`, and if `n` is 1, the condition does not hold nor does the post-condition apply.
- The post-condition involves the loop termination state, not intermediate states.

**Can it be modified to create a valid invariant?**

Yes, the post-condition can be turned into a broader loop invariant expressing a property that is true before, during, and after iterations:

- Since `x` starts at 1 and is incremented up to but not including `n`, and since `m` is only assigned values of `x` when `unknown()` is true,
- a suitable invariant could be:

```
1 <= m < n           AND
1 <= x <= n
```

More precisely:

**Proposed invariant:**

- `1 <= m < n` (m is always at least 1 and less than n)
- `1 <= x <= n` (x progresses from 1 to n)

This invariant is stronger than the post-condition and can be established before the loop and maintained within the loop.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed invariant in natural language:**

- At the start and end of each iteration of the loop:
  - The variable `m` always holds a value between 1 (inclusive) and `n` (exclusive).
  - The variable `x` always holds a value between 1 (inclusive) and `n` (inclusive).

**Why is this invariant valid?**

- Initially, `m = 1`, which satisfies `1 <= m < n` assuming `n > 1`.
- The variable `x` starts at 1, satisfying `1 <= x <= n`.
- Inside the loop:
  - `x` increments by 1 each iteration but never reaches `n` inside the loop (loop runs while `x < n`).
  - `m` is only assigned values of `x`, which are always less than `n`.
- Therefore, `m < n` holds at every point during the loop.
- `x` eventually reaches `n`, causing the loop to exit, while `m` remains less than `n`.

This invariant captures the necessary bounds on `m` and `x` ensuring correctness.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established initially?**

- Before the loop begins:
  - `x = 1` so `1 <= x <= n` holds (assuming `n >= 1`).
  - `m = 1` so `1 <= m < n` holds if `n > 1`.
- The precondition `n > 1` (implied by the post-condition check) guarantees `m = 1 < n`.
  
Thus, the proposed invariant holds before the loop starts.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved during the loop?**

Assuming the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:

- `1 <= m < n`
- `1 <= x < n` (because loop condition is `x < n`)

Loop body:

1. `if (unknown()) m = x;`:

   - `m` is assigned `x` only if some unknown condition holds.
   - Since `x < n`, assigning `m = x` maintains `m < n`.

2. `x = x + 1;`

   - `x` is incremented by 1.
   - Since start `x < n`, incrementing `x` results in `x <= n`.

At end of iteration:

- `1 <= m < n` maintained because `m` only assigned to values `< n`.
- `1 <= x <= n` maintained after increment.

Therefore, the invariant remains true.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**When does the loop terminate?**

- When the loop condition `x < n` becomes false.
- So, at loop termination, `x >= n`.

Because `x` increments stepwise and starts at 1, termination occurs when `x == n`.

At termination:

- From the invariant, `m < n`
- Now, `x == n`

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition:**

```c
(n > 1) ==> (m < n);
```

**Is the post-condition correct?**

- Yes, it follows directly from the invariant and loop termination.
- At termination, from invariant, `m < n` remains true.
- If `n > 1`, the initial establishment and preservation ensures `m` never reaches or exceeds `n`.
  
**Explanation of correctness with invariant and condition negation:**

- Invariant: `m < n`
- Loop exit condition: `!(x < n)` ⇒ `x >= n`
- Because `x` increments by 1 each iteration from 1, it must equal `n` on termination.
- Since `m` is only assigned values less than `n`, and initial `m = 1` (also < `n` for `n > 1`), `m < n` holds at termination.
- Hence the assertion `(n > 1) ==> (m < n)` is proven.

---

# **Summary / Formal Comments**

```c
    /*@
      loop invariant 1 <= m < n;
      loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;
    */
```

- The invariant expresses that `m` and `x` are always within expected bounds.
- It respects establishment, preservation, and termination conditions related to the assertion.

2025-12-23 05:25:14,551 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(m == 1) * (x == 1) * (z3 == \at(z3,Pre)) * (z2 == \at(z2,Pre)) * (z1 == \at(z1,Pre)) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


void foo21(int n,int z1,int z2,int z3) {
    int x = 1;
    int m = 1;

    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

    }
