### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**

  The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `k` and advances `i` and `j` simultaneously by incrementing each by 1 on every iteration. The intended outcome is to increase both `i` and `j` stepwise until the condition `i <= k` no longer holds.

  After the loop terminates, the code asserts that `i == j`. This means the loop’s purpose is to maintain the relationship between `i` and `j` such that they are equal at the end.

- **Loop Structure**

  - **Loop condition:** `while (i <= k)`
  - **Loop body:** 
    - `i++` (increasing `i` by 1)
    - `j = j + 1` (increasing `j` by 1)
  - **Relevant variables:** 
    - `i`: initialization 0, incremented in each iteration
    - `j`: initialization 0, incremented in each iteration
    - `k`: unknown initial value and remains unchanged

  The loop continues from `i=0` (initial) until `i > k`.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Start state before loop:  
- `i = 0`  
- `j = 0`  
- `k` is some integer value, unknown, but assumed constant during loop.

Assuming `k ≥ 0` for the loop to execute.

We will show `i` and `j` values at the start of each iteration (before increment) and after loop body (after increment).

| Iteration | Before increment (start) | After increment (end of iteration) |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 0 (initial) | i=0, j=0               | i=1, j=1                          |
| 1         | i=1, j=1                | i=2, j=2                          |
| 2         | i=2, j=2                | i=3, j=3                          |
| 3         | i=3, j=3                | i=4, j=4                          |
| 4         | i=4, j=4                | i=5, j=5                          |

At each iteration, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 simultaneously, maintaining equality.

If `k=4`, the loop runs while `i <= 4`.

- After iteration 0: `i=1`, `j=1` (condition: `1 <= 4` true)
- After iteration 1: `i=2`, `j=2` (`2 <= 4` true)
- After iteration 2: `i=3`, `j=3` (`3 <= 4` true)
- After iteration 3: `i=4`, `j=4` (`4 <= 4` true)
- After iteration 4: `i=5`, `j=5` (`5 <= 4` false, loop exits)

**Post-loop sampling:**  
At loop termination condition `i = k+1`, `j = k+1`

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
  `assert(i == j);`  
  The goal is to prove that after the loop finishes, `i == j` holds true.

- **Can the verification goal be used directly as an invariant?**  
  - The condition `i == j` can actually hold throughout every iteration, not only at termination.
  - At initialization before the loop, `i = 0` and `j = 0`, so initially `i == j` is true.
  - Each loop iteration increments both `i` and `j` by 1, preserving equality.

- **Conclusion:**  
  The verification goal `i == j` is suitable to serve as the loop invariant because it satisfies:  
  - **Establishment:** True before loop starts.  
  - **Preservation:** If true at iteration start, remains true after iteration.  
  - **Termination:** Since loop exits when `i > k`, and invariant states `i == j`, post condition `i == j` holds at loop exit.

Hence, no modification is needed.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed loop invariant (in natural language):**  
  *At the beginning of every loop iteration, the variables `i` and `j` are equal.*

- **Why is this invariant valid?**  
  1. **Initialization:** When the loop begins, `i` and `j` are both initialized to zero, so `i == j` is true.  
  2. **Maintenance:** The loop body increments both `i` and `j` exactly once each iteration, preserving the equality `i == j`.  
  3. **Termination:** When the loop condition `i <= k` is false, we have `i == j` and `i > k`; thus, `i == j` holds at termination.

---

### e. Establishment

- **How is the invariant established before the loop?**  
  Initially:  
  ```c
  i = 0;
  j = 0;
  ```
  So before the first loop iteration, `i == j` holds because both are zero.

- **Pre-condition guarantees:**  
  There are no explicit assumptions about `k` made before the loop, but regardless of `k`, at loop entry `i == j` is true because both are initialized explicitly.

---

### f. Preservation

- **How is the invariant preserved through one iteration?**  
  Assume at the start of a loop iteration, `i == j`. After the loop body executes:  
  ```c
  i++;
  j = j + 1;
  ```
  Both increase by 1, so equality remains:  

  Before increment: `i == j = x`  
  After increment: `i = x + 1`, `j = x + 1`  
  So invariant holds at the end of the iteration.

- **Furthermore, the loop continues only if `i <= k`. This condition does not affect equality preservation.**

---

### g. Termination Analysis

- **When does the loop terminate?**  
  When condition `i <= k` is false, i.e., when `i > k`.

- **State of variables at termination:**  
  Since invariant `i == j` holds at every iteration start and end, it holds at termination as well. So at termination:  
  - `i = j`  
  - `i > k`

- **Does invariant remain valid under termination?**  
  Yes, invariant `i == j` still holds, and the loop stopping condition `i > k` defines that the loop cannot continue.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Is the post-condition `assert(i == j)` correct?**  
  Yes, based on the invariant and loop behavior, `i == j` holds true at loop exit.

- **How do invariant and loop termination imply post-condition?**  
  At termination:  
  - Loop condition: `!(i <= k)` => `i > k`  
  - Invariant: `i == j`  
  Together, they imply:  
  - `i == j` holds (invariant)  
  - Loop has ended because `i > k` (termination)  
  Hence the post-condition `i == j` is proven by combining the invariant with loop exit condition.

---

# **Summary of Proposed Loop Invariant**

```c
/*@ 
  loop invariant i == j;
*/
```

- This invariant is established at initialization.
- It is preserved by the increment operations.
- At loop termination, it still holds, combined with `i > k`.
- Therefore, it proves the final assertion `i == j`.

---

If you want, I can further demonstrate a detailed formal verification proof or provide annotations with additional specifications such as loop variant to prove termination. Just let me know!
