### Code snippet under analysis:

```c
void foo124(int x, int y) {

    int i = x;
    int j = y;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    /*@
    */

        x = x - 1;
        y = y - 1;

    }

    /*@ assert (i == j) ==> (y == 0); */

}
```

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

  The loop repeatedly decrements both `x` and `y` by 1 simultaneously until `x` reaches zero. Its intended outcome is to reduce the value of `x` down to zero, while also reducing `y` by the same number of steps.

  Intuitively, it synchronously steps both variables down to zero for `x`, adjusting `y` alongside.

- **Structure:**

  - **Governing condition:** `while (x != 0)`.
    The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not zero.

  - **Loop body operations:**
    - `x = x - 1;`
    - `y = y - 1;`
  
  - **Variables relevant:**
    - `x`: loop control variable, decremented in each iteration until zero.
    - `y`: decremented with `x` in lockstep.
    - `i`, `j`: initial copies of `x` and `y` before the loop starts (used later in the post-condition).

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We will sample values before the loop and after each of the first five iterations:

Let’s denote initial values before the loop as:  
`x_0 = i` (initial x), `y_0 = j` (initial y).

**Pre-loop sample:**  
- Iteration 0 (before any iteration):  
  `x = i`, `y = j`

---

**After iteration 1:**  
- `x = i - 1`  
- `y = j - 1`

**After iteration 2:**  
- `x = i - 2`  
- `y = j - 2`

**After iteration 3:**  
- `x = i - 3`  
- `y = j - 3`

**After iteration 4:**  
- `x = i - 4`  
- `y = j - 4`

**After iteration 5:**  
- `x = i - 5`  
- `y = j - 5`

---

**Note:** The loop terminates when `x == 0`. The number of iterations executed is exactly `i` (assuming `i >= 0`). The loop cannot run if `i == 0` initially.

- **Post-loop sample:**  
  When the loop terminates:

  ```
  x == 0
  y == j - i
  ```

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification goal (post-condition) to be proven:**  
  ```
  (i == j) ==> (y == 0);
  ```
  Meaning: *If the initial values of `x` and `y` are equal, then at the end of the loop, `y` should be zero.*

---

- **Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

  - **NO.** The goal requires `y == 0` at termination, but in the intermediate iterations `y` will generally not be zero (it decrements gradually).
  - The verification goal is a **post-condition** that applies **only after the loop terminates**, not during iterations.

---

- **Can it be modified to form a valid loop invariant?**

  Yes. Observe that during the loop, the difference `x - y` remains invariant because both decrement by 1 each iteration. But since `y` decrements with `x`, the difference between `x` and `y` changes only if their initial values differ.

In fact, the difference:

\[
(x - y) = (i - j)
\]

should hold true at the **start and end of each loop iteration**.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

  *“At the beginning and end of each iteration of the loop, the difference between `x` and `y` remains constant and equal to the difference `i - j` from the initial values.”*

Formally:

```
x - y == i - j
```

- **Why is this invariant valid?**

  - Initially, `x = i` and `y = j`, so `x - y = i - j`.
  - Each iteration decrements both `x` and `y` by 1, so the difference `x - y` does not change.
  - Thus, this property holds before the loop starts, after every iteration, and at termination.

---

## e. Establishment

- **How is the invariant established?**

  - Before the loop starts:

    ```
    x = i
    y = j
    ```

  - Therefore,

    ```
    x - y = i - j
    ```
    
  This matches the invariant exactly, so the invariant is **established** before the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

- **How is the invariant preserved?**

  Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:

  ```
  x - y = i - j
  ```

  The loop body executes:

  ```
  x = x - 1
  y = y - 1
  ```

  After the iteration:

  ```
  new_x - new_y = (x - 1) - (y - 1) = x - y = i - j
  ```

  So the invariant still holds after the iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- **When does the loop terminate?**

  When:

  ```
  x == 0
  ```

  At this point:

  From the invariant:

  ```
  x - y = i - j
  0 - y = i - j
  y = j - i
  ```

---

- **Why is the invariant valid at termination?**

  The invariant holds throughout execution, so at termination when `x == 0`, the invariant implies:

  ```
  y == j - i
  ```

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition:

  ```
  (i == j) ==> (y == 0)
  ```

  **Is this correct?**

  Yes — if initially `i == j`, then from termination analysis:

  ```
  y == j - i == 0
  ```

- **How does the invariant combined with termination imply the post-condition?**

  Given:

  ```
  x == 0  (loop termination)
  x - y == i - j  (invariant)
  ```

  Rearranged, at termination:

  ```
  y = j - i
  ```

  So if `i == j`, then:

  ```
  y = j - i = 0
  ```

  Matching the post-condition exactly.

---

# **Summary:**

| Aspect  | Explanation  |
|---------|--------------|
| **Loop purpose** | Decrement both `x` and `y` simultaneously until `x` reaches zero. |
| **Variables** | `x` (loop control), `y` (modified alongside), `i`, `j` initial copies of `x`, `y`. |
| **Invariant** | `x - y == i - j` (the difference between `x` and `y` remains constant). |
| **Establishment** | Holds trivially before the loop (initial values). |
| **Preservation** | Each iteration reduces `x` and `y` equally, maintaining their difference. |
| **Termination** | Loop stops when `x == 0`; invariant implies `y == j - i`. |
| **Post-condition correctness** | If `i == j`, then `y == 0` on termination. Verified from invariant + termination. |

---

# **Final formal loop invariant:**

```c
/*@
    loop invariant x - y == i - j;
*/
```

This invariant meets:

1. **Establishment:** True before the first iteration.
2. **Preservation:** Maintained by each decrement.
3. **Termination:** Combined with `x == 0` implies post-condition `(i == j) ==> (y == 0)`.

If you want, I can also help express this invariant in formal annotations like ACSL or comments suitable for static analysis tools. Let me know!

2025-12-23 00:28:41,243 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(j == \at(y,Pre)) * (i == \at(x,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo124(int x, int y) {

    int i = x;
    int j = y;

2025-12-23 00:29:08,530 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this problem, I need to analyze the loop and fill in the placeholders for the loop invariants.

## Analysis

**Loop behavior:**
- Decrements both `x` and `y` by 1 each iteration
- Continues while `x != 0`
- `i` and `j` store initial values of `x` and `y`

**Key insight:**
The difference `x - y` remains constant throughout the loop since both variables decrease by the same amount each iteration. Initially, `x - y = i - j`.

**Verification goal:**
`(i == j) ==> (y == 0)`

Can this be used directly as a loop invariant? **No** - because during intermediate iterations, if `i == j`, we have `y = j - number_of_iterations`, which is only 0 when the loop terminates (when `x == 0`).

However, the relationship `x - y == i - j` holds throughout and implies the verification goal at termination.

**For the placeholders:**

1. **PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL**: The verification goal doesn't hold during the loop, but we can express what does hold: the invariant relationship `x - y == i - j`

2. **PLACE_HOLDER_x**: Need a property about `x` - it should be non-negative (assuming standard termination)

3. **PLACE_HOLDER_y**: The relationship involving `y` follows from the invariant: `x - y == i - j`, which can be rewritten as `y == j - (i - x)`

4. **PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS**: The loop modifies `x` and `y`

```c
void foo124(int x, int y) {

    int i = x;
    int j = y;

    /*@
      loop invariant (\at(x,Pre) != 0) ==> (x - y == i - j);
      loop invariant (\at(x,Pre) != 0) ==> (x >= 0);
      loop invariant (\at(x,Pre) != 0) ==> (y == j - (i - x));
      loop invariant (!(\at(x,Pre) != 0)) ==> ((j == \at(y,Pre))&&(i == \at(x,Pre))&&(y == \at(y,Pre))&&(x == \at(x,Pre)));
      loop invariant j == \at(y,Pre);
      loop invariant i == \at(x,Pre);
      loop assigns x, y;
