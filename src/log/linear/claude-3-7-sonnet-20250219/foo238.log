2025-12-22 21:47:16,992 - INFO  - think in natural language: Certainly! Below is a detailed, formal loop verification analysis for the provided C code snippet:

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**  
The loop is designed to repeatedly increment three unsigned integer variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. In each iteration:  
- `i` is incremented by 1,  
- `j` is incremented by 2, and  
- `k` is incremented by 3.  

The loop continues executing while `k` is strictly less than 268,435,455 (which is close to \(2^{28}\)). The intended outcome seems to be a proportional increase of these variables—`k` grows three times faster than `i`—until `k` reaches or exceeds the threshold.

**Loop structure:**  
- **Condition:** The guard is `while (k < 268435455)`. This means the loop executes as long as `k` is less than that value.  
- **Body operations:** The loop body increments `i`, `j`, and `k` by fixed constants: `i += 1; j += 2; k += 3;`.  
- **Relevant variables:** Only `i`, `j`, and `k` are manipulated and thus relevant. Initial values of each is 0 just before the loop starts.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We will sample variable values before the loop starts, and then after each iteration for the first five iterations.

| Sample Point         | i   | j    | k      |
|---------------------|-----|------|--------|
| Pre-loop (initial)   | 0   | 0    | 0      |
| After iteration 1    | 1   | 2    | 3      |
| After iteration 2    | 2   | 4    | 6      |
| After iteration 3    | 3   | 6    | 9      |
| After iteration 4    | 4   | 8    | 12     |
| After iteration 5    | 5   | 10   | 15     |

- Because `k` increments by 3 every iteration starting from 0, `k` after `n` iterations equals `3*n`.  
- Likewise, `i = n` and `j = 2*n` after `n` iterations, for these samples.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
- Given the loop condition `k < 268435455`, the loop will execute many more iterations (> 89 million). Thus, the loop won't terminate within these first five iterations.  
- Upon actual termination, `k` will be at least 268,435,455 (when the condition `k < 268435455` becomes false).

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
```c
/*@ assert k == 3 * i; */
```

The goal is to prove that at the end of the loop (after it exits), `k` is exactly triple `i`.

**Can this be an invariant?**  
- **NO**, the verification goal as given is not immediately sufficient as an invariant in its strict equality form for all times during the loop. Let's analyze:  
    - At initialization, `k = 0` and `i = 0`, so `k == 3 * i` holds.  
    - After each iteration, `k` increments by 3 and `i` by 1, so equality holds after each iteration too.  
    - However, the loop body is the only place where these variables change; there's no other code altering the variables within the loop.  
    - The equality is *exactly* maintained during all iterations. So it looks like it *can* be an invariant.

Actually, the equality looks **exactly maintained** each iteration, so it *can* serve as the loop invariant.

*Further reasoning:*  
- The invariant requires to be true at the start and end of every iteration, which it appears to be.  
- The verification goal is exactly the final assertion, which is `k == 3 * i`.

Hence, this equality **can** serve as the loop invariant.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**  
At the start and end of every loop iteration, the variable `k` is exactly three times the value of `i`. Formally:  
\[ k = 3 \times i \]

**Detailed explanation why it is valid:**  
- Initialization: When the loop begins, both `i` and `k` are zero; thus `k = 3 * i = 0`.  
- Each iteration increments `i` by 1 and `k` by 3, so after the iteration `k` remains three times `i`.  
- Since no other operations modify `i` or `k`, this relationship is always preserved.  
- Therefore, the invariant holds before entering the loop, during each iteration at both entry and exit points, and immediately before the loop exits.

Note: `j` is incremented by 2 each time but is not part of the invariant or the assertion.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established before the loop starts?**  

- Initial values: `i = 0`, `k = 0`.  
- Therefore, before the first iteration:  
  \[ k = 0 = 3 \times 0 = 3 \times i \]  
- The invariant holds true before the loop's first iteration (base case).

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved during the loop body?**  

Assume the invariant holds at the start of the iteration:  
\[
k = 3 \times i
\]

The loop body executes:  
\[
i := i + 1
\]
\[
k := k + 3
\]

Check the invariant at the loop end:  
\[
k_{new} = k + 3 = 3 \times i + 3 = 3 \times (i + 1) = 3 \times i_{new}
\]

Thus, if `k = 3 * i` before iteration, it holds after iteration as well.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

**Loop termination condition:**  
The loop runs while  
\[
k < 268435455
\]

It terminates at the first step where this condition is false; i.e.,  
\[
k \geq 268435455
\]

Let the loop run for \(n\) iterations, for some \(n\) such that:  
\[
3n = k \geq 268435455
\]

At this point:  
- \(i = n\); so  
- \(k = 3 \times i\) still holds due to the invariant.  

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition is:
  \[
  k == 3 \times i
  \]

- The loop invariant establishes exactly this relationship before entering and after every iteration.  
- When the loop terminates, the condition \(k \geq 268435455\) holds alongside the invariant \(k = 3 \times i\).  
- Since the invariant holds at termination, the post-condition is **correct**.

**How does the invariant and loop termination imply post-condition?**  
- Upon termination:  
  \[
  \neg (k < 268435455) \Rightarrow k \geq 268435455
  \]
- From the invariant:  
  \[
  k = 3 \times i
  \]
- Therefore:
  \[
  k == 3 \times i
  \]
- Hence the post-condition logically follows.

---

# **Summary of Findings**

- The **loop invariant \(k = 3 \times i\)** is true at:  
    - initialization (before the loop starts),  
    - maintained (preserved) by each iteration,  
    - and at termination (when the loop condition fails).  
- The **post-condition \(k == 3 \times i\)** follows directly from the invariant and loop termination condition.  
- This invariant is valid and sufficient to prove the final assertion.
