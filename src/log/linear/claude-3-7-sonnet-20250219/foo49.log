## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop continues as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- Variable `c` is manipulated inside the loop body dependent on two calls to `unknown()`.
- If the first `unknown()` in the loop body returns true and `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` is incremented by one.
- If that first `unknown()` returns false and `c` equals `n`, then `c` is reset to 1.
- The variable `n` is a positive integer (`n > 0`), read-only in the function.
  
The intended effect appears to be a conditional increment/reset of `c` in reaction to unpredictable `unknown()` outcomes, constrained by `n`.

---

**Loop Structure:**

- Loop condition: `while (unknown())` — the loop continues while this external unknown condition is true.
- Loop body:
  - Evaluate `unknown()`:
    - If `true`:
      - If `c != n`, increment `c`.
    - Else:
      - If `c == n`, reset `c = 1`.
- Relevant variables:
  - `c`: an integer initialized to 0 before the loop and updated in the loop.
  - `n`: input parameter, constant during execution, with `n > 0`.
- The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns `false` in the while condition.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Because both the loop-controlling `unknown()` and the inner conditional `unknown()` return arbitrary values undefined at compile time, precise sampling of concrete values is impossible statically. Instead, we analyze logically possible value flows through iterations.

- **Pre-loop sample:**

  - `c = 0`
  - `n > 0` (input precondition)

---

- **Iter 1:**

  - Assume first inner `unknown()` returns `true`:
    - `c != n`? Initially 0 vs n > 0 so yes.
    - `c` increments: `c = 1`
  - Assume first inner `unknown()` returns `false`:
    - `c == n`? 0 == n? No, so no change.
  - Therefore, after 1st iteration, `c ∈ {0, 1}` depending on inner unknown.

---

- **Iter 2:**

  Similar logic applies:

  - If inner `unknown()` true and `c != n`:
    - `c` increments (from 1 if incremented last time).
  - If inner `unknown()` false and `c == n`:
    - reset `c = 1`.
  
  Since `c` can increment up to `n`, or possibly reset to 1 if `c == n`.

---

- **Iter 3 to Iter 5:**

The pattern repeats:

- `c` grows from 0 towards `n` by increments when conditions allow.
- If at any iteration inner `unknown()` is false and `c == n`, `c` resets to 1.
- `c` never exceeds `n` due to the check `if (c != n)`.
- `c` is always at least 0, never negative.

---

- **Post-loop (if terminates within 5 iterations):**

Because the loop depends on `unknown()`, termination time is unknown.

- Upon termination (first `while(unknown())` evaluates to false):
  - `c` holds whatever value it last had after the last iteration.
  - Based on increments and resets, `c` is in `[0, n]`.
  - `c` could be equal to `n` or less.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert (n <= -1) ==> (c != n ); */
```

- The post-condition states: If `n <= -1`, then `c != n`.

- Given the function precondition is `n > 0`,
  - `n <= -1` is impossible for valid inputs.
  - Therefore, the assertion is vacuously true because its antecedent is false.

---

**Can this verification goal serve as loop invariant?**

- No.
- The post-condition refers to an unreachable condition `n <= -1`, contradicting the input precondition.
- It clearly cannot be used as a non-trivial invariant since it talks about an input value range never occurring.
- It is not useful as a loop invariant because:
  - It's false or irrelevant during iterations for all valid inputs.
  - Loop invariants must be meaningful for all execution steps, but this assertion only applies in impossible cases.

---

**Can it be modified to form a valid invariant?**

- Since the assertion relates input `n` (outside the valid range) to variable `c`, it is not relevant for invariant construction.
- The invariant should focus on properties of `c` and `n` under the actual precondition `n > 0`.
- A more meaningful invariant should constrain `c` relative to `n` under all loop iterations.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant (natural language):**

- At the start and end of every loop iteration:
  
  > "The variable `c` is always between 0 and `n` inclusive, i.e., `0 <= c <= n`."

**Explanation:**

- Before the loop, `c = 0`, so invariant holds.
- Inside the loop:
  - `c` increments only if `c != n`, so it cannot exceed `n`.
  - `c` resets to 1 only when `c == n`.
  - No code decreases `c` below 0.
- Therefore, `c` never surpasses `n` nor becomes negative.
- This bounds `c` stably throughout the loop lifetime.

---

## e. Establishment

- **How it holds before first iteration:**

- Initial value `c = 0`.
- Given `n > 0`.
- So `0 <= c <= n` holds.
- Hence the invariant is established before the loop begins.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `0 <= c <= n`.
- In loop body:
  - If `unknown()` true:
    - If `c != n`, `c = c + 1`.
    - Then new `c <= n` since increment only allowed if `c < n`.
  - If `unknown()` false:
    - If `c == n`, `c` resets to 1.
    - `1` is within `[0,n]` since `n > 0`.
  - No other modification to `c`.
- Therefore, after iteration:

  - `c` remains within `0 <= c <= n`.

Invariant is preserved.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- Loop terminates when `unknown()` (the while condition) is false.

- At termination:

  - `c` satisfies `0 <= c <= n` (by invariant).

- The loop invariant still holds at exit.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- Post-condition: `(n <= -1) ==> (c != n)`

  - Given input precondition `n > 0`, `n <= -1` is impossible.
  - So the post-condition is *vacuously* true.
  - It does not provide meaningful correctness guarantee for valid runs.

- Combined with loop invariant and termination condition:

  - Since the loop invariant states `0 <= c <= n` and `n > 0`, `c` is meaningful.
  - However, the post-condition poses no concrete restriction because premise never holds.

---

# **Summary:**

| Aspect                       | Conclusion                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loop purpose                | Manipulate counter `c` within bounds `[0,n]` according to external conditions.                 |
| Loop invariant (proposed)   | `0 <= c <= n` holds before, during, and after each iteration.                                 |
| Invariant establishment    | Holds initially (`c=0`, `n>0`).                                                                |
| Invariant preservation      | Increment and reset ensure `c` remains in `[0, n]`.                                            |
| Termination condition       | Loop ends when `unknown()` false — invariant remains valid.                                   |
| Post-condition correctness | Vacuously true (antecedent contradicts function precondition), so holds trivially.            |
| Suggestion                  | Replace post-condition with meaningful condition matching `n>0` and expected invariant on `c`. |

2025-12-22 23:04:43,583 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (c == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires n > 0;
    */
    
void foo49(int n) {

    int c = 0;
