### Given Code

```c
void foo255() {

    int v;

    v = 1;

    /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
    
    /*@
    */
    while (v <= 50) {
        v = v + 2;
    }

    /*@ assert v <= 52; */

}
```

---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

  The loop’s purpose is to repeatedly increment the variable `v` by 2, starting from an initial value of 1, until the value of `v` exceeds 50. Effectively, the loop produces successive odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the first odd number greater than 50.

- **Loop Structure:**

  - **Loop condition:** `v <= 50`
  
  - **Loop body:** Increment `v` by 2 (`v = v + 2;`)
  
  - **Relevant variable:** The integer `v` controls the loop; it is initialized before the loop (`v=1`) and updated inside.

  Because `v` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration, the sequence of `v` values during the loop will be odd numbers increasing.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's enumerate the value of `v` at key points: initially and after each iteration, up to iteration 5 or until termination.

- **Pre-loop (before iteration 1):**

  - `v = 1`
  
- **After 1st iteration:**

  - `v = 1 + 2 = 3`
  
- **After 2nd iteration:**

  - `v = 3 + 2 = 5`
  
- **After 3rd iteration:**

  - `v = 5 + 2 = 7`
  
- **After 4th iteration:**

  - `v = 7 + 2 = 9`
  
- **After 5th iteration:**

  - `v = 9 + 2 = 11`

---

Since the loop condition is `v <= 50`, let’s see when it terminates. The increments add 2 each iteration starting at 1:

- The last `v` satisfying `v <= 50` is `49` (since `49 <= 50`)
- Next iteration after 49 would yield `49 + 2 = 51` which is > 50, so loop terminates.

Note that after the iteration that sets `v = 49`, the next iteration will set `v = 51` and terminate the loop.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification goal (post-condition):**

  ```
  assert v <= 52;
  ```

  The goal is to prove that after loop termination, `v` is at most 52.

- **Can this post-condition be part of the invariant?**

  - **No.** Because before the loop and during iterations, `v` could be less than or equal to 50, which is certainly ≤ 52. But after some iterations, for example, at the start of the loop, `v=1` which satisfies `v <= 52`.

  Crucially, the post-condition `v <= 52` is trivially true during the loop iterations because `v` grows from 1 upward by 2, and only exceeds 50 by a small margin before termination.

  However, this post-condition is *not sufficient* to fully characterize the iteration logic since it simply places an upper bound after termination but does not detail behavior during iterations.

- **Can the post-condition be used (or modified) as an invariant?**

  To be inductive, the invariant needs to capture something about all states during the loop's execution.

  A strong candidate invariant would reflect that:

  1. `v` is always an odd integer ≥ 1 (since increments are by 2),
  
  2. `v` has not yet surpassed 52 (it doesn't leap beyond 52),
  
  3. `v` only takes values of the form `1 + 2*k` for some integer k ≥ 0.

Thus, a more precise loop invariant might be:

```
v is odd, v >= 1, and v <= 51
```

Why 51? Because 51 is the first odd number greater than 50 (the loop condition bound). The loop increments until reaching a value just above 50, i.e., at 51 the loop terminates.

This modified invariant:

- Holds initially (`v=1`),

- Preserved under increments by 2 while `v <= 50`,

- Implies the post-condition `v <= 52` upon termination (since loop exits when `v > 50`, the smallest such odd value is 51, and 51 ≤ 52).

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

  "At the beginning and end of every loop iteration:

  - The variable `v` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1.

  - The value of `v` is less than or equal to 51."

- **Why this invariant is valid:**

  - Initially `v = 1`, which is odd, ≥1, and ≤51.

  - Every iteration adds 2 to `v`, preserving oddness and increasing it by exactly 2.

  - Since the loop condition is `v <= 50`, `v` never increases beyond 51 inside the loop; the loop exits when `v` becomes 51 or greater.

  - Values of `v` during iterations are in `{1,3,5,...,49}`.

---

## e. Establishment

- The invariant is established before the first iteration because:

  - `v` is initialized to 1.

  - 1 is odd.

  - 1 ≥ 1.

  - 1 ≤ 51.

Thus, the invariant holds true upon entering the loop for the first time.

---

## f. Preservation

- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, i.e.,

  - `v` is odd,

  - `1 <= v <= 51`,

  - and the loop condition `v <= 50` is true.

- During the loop body, `v` is incremented by 2:

  - Adding 2 to an odd number produces another odd number. Thus, oddness is preserved.

  - Because the loop condition is true at the start, `v <= 50`. Thus, `v + 2 <= 52`.

- Check invariant after increment:

  - `v + 2` is odd.

  - `v + 2 >= 3` (since `v >= 1`).

  - `v + 2 <= 52` but the invariant bounds `v` by 51, so need to see if `v + 2 <= 51` holds.

- Since loop continues while `v <= 50`, maximum `v` before increment is 50:

  - But 50 is even, contradiction — since we said `v` is always odd.

Actually, need to reconcile this important detail:

- Starting from `v=1` (odd), adding +2 repeatedly keeps `v` always odd.

- The loop condition is `v <= 50`.

- At some point when `v = 49` (odd, ≤50), loop runs, `v` becomes 51 (`49+2`), now the condition `v <= 50` is false and loop terminates.

Thus, the invariant upper bound should be `v <= 51`.

Reexamining preservation with this:

- If at start of iteration `v` is odd and `1 <= v <= 50` (because loop condition is `v <= 50`),

- Then after increment `v := v + 2`, 

- `v ≤ 52` but since `v` increments from odd → odd by +2, next odd after ≤50 is ≤ 51.

- So, `v <= 51` holds after increment as well.

Hence the increment preserves:

- Oddness.

- Lower bound ≥ 1.

- Upper bound `v <= 51`.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates when `v <= 50` is false, i.e., when `v > 50`.

- Considering only odd values starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, ..., 49, 51,...):

  - The first `v` after exceeding 50 is `51`.

- Upon termination:

  - `v` is odd.

  - `v = 51`.

  - The invariant still holds since `v <= 51` and `v` is odd and ≥ 1.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition:**

  ```
  assert v <= 52;
  ```

- Is this post-condition correct?

  - Yes, `v` will be at most 51 at termination, thus definitely `v <= 52`.

- **How invariant and negation of loop condition imply post-condition:**

  - Invariant: `v` is odd, `1 <= v <= 51`

  - Loop termination condition: `v > 50`

  Combining:

  - When loop ends, `v >= 51` (odd, ≥ 1, ≤ 51 from invariant) ⇒ `v = 51`.

  Hence `v <= 52` holds, proving post-condition.

---

# **Summary and Final Proposed Loop Invariant**

```c
/*@
  loop invariant v >= 1 && v % 2 == 1 && v <= 51;
*/
while (v <= 50) {
    v = v + 2;
}
```

- This invariant states:

  - `v` is always odd,

  - `v` is at least 1,

  - `v` never exceeds 51 during any iteration.

- It is established before the loop.

- It is preserved by each iteration.

- It implies the post-condition when the loop exits.

If you want, I can help with formal annotations using ACSL or other specification languages too! But this natural language and reasoning covers the essential elements of loop verification for `foo255()`.
