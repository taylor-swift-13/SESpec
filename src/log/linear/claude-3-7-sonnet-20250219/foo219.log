## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop is designed to conditionally increment a counter variable `s`. However, due to its specific logic, it creates a situation where `s` will never actually be incremented despite the presence of increment code.

**Structure:**
- **Loop condition:** `while(unknown())` - The loop continues as long as the `unknown()` function returns a non-zero (true) value. This is a non-deterministic condition.
- **Loop body:** Contains a single conditional statement:
  ```c
  if (s != 0) {
      s = s + 1;
  }
  ```
- **Relevant variables:** 
  - `s`: Integer variable initialized to 0 before the loop. Only modified inside the conditional within the loop body.

**Key observation:** The loop body only increments `s` when `s != 0`. Since `s` starts at 0, and the only way to change `s` is through the increment (which requires `s` to already be non-zero), `s` will remain 0 throughout all iterations.

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sample (Before first iteration):**
- `s = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sample 1 (After 1st iteration):**
- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns true
- Conditional check: `s != 0` evaluates to `false` (since `s == 0`)
- Body action: No change to `s`
- `s = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sample 2 (After 2nd iteration):**
- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns true
- Conditional check: `s != 0` evaluates to `false`
- Body action: No change to `s`
- `s = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sample 3 (After 3rd iteration):**
- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns true
- Conditional check: `s != 0` evaluates to `false`
- Body action: No change to `s`
- `s = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sample 4 (After 4th iteration):**
- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns true
- Conditional check: `s != 0` evaluates to `false`
- Body action: No change to `s`
- `s = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sample 5 (After 5th iteration):**
- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns true
- Conditional check: `s != 0` evaluates to `false`
- Body action: No change to `s`
- `s = 0`

**Post-Loop Sample (When loop terminates):**
- Loop condition: `unknown()` returns false
- `s = 0` (unchanged from all previous iterations)

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
The post-condition that needs to be proven is: `s == 0`

**Can the verification goal serve as the loop invariant?**

**YES.** The verification goal `s == 0` can be directly used as the loop invariant.

**Explanation:**
The condition `s == 0` is not merely a post-condition that holds only at termination—it is actually true throughout the entire execution of the loop:

1. **Before the loop:** `s` is explicitly initialized to 0
2. **During every iteration:** The conditional `if (s != 0)` prevents any modification to `s` when `s == 0`. Since `s` starts at 0, this condition is always false, meaning `s` is never incremented and always remains 0.
3. **At termination:** Since `s` was never modified during any iteration, it remains 0 when the loop exits.

The verification goal satisfies all three requirements:
- **Establishment:** `s == 0` holds before the first iteration
- **Preservation:** `s == 0` is maintained through each iteration (the conditional prevents modification)
- **Termination:** `s == 0` combined with the negated loop condition (`!unknown()`) trivially implies the post-condition `s == 0`

**No modification needed:** The verification goal itself is a perfect loop invariant.

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language):**
"The variable `s` always equals 0 throughout the execution of the loop."

**Formal Expression:**
```c
s == 0
```

**Detailed Validity Explanation:**

This invariant is valid because of the logical structure of the loop body:

1. **Initial State:** Variable `s` is initialized to 0 before the loop begins.

2. **Conditional Guard:** The only statement that could modify `s` is `s = s + 1`, but this statement is guarded by the condition `if (s != 0)`.

3. **Logical Lock:** This creates a logical "lock" where:
   - If `s == 0`, then `s != 0` is false, so `s` is not incremented
   - For `s` to be incremented, it would need to already be non-zero
   - Since `s` starts at 0 and can never be changed from 0 (due to the guard), it remains 0 forever

4. **Invariance Property:** Because `s` cannot be modified when it equals 0, and it starts at 0, the invariant `s == 0` holds:
   - At the start of every iteration
   - At the end of every iteration
   - When the loop terminates

This invariant is true across all samples taken in section (b), confirming its validity empirically as well as logically.

## e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established:**

The invariant `s == 0` is established by the explicit initialization statement before the loop:

```c
s = 0;
```

**Pre-condition guarantee:**

Before the first iteration of the loop begins, the program has executed `s = 0`, which directly establishes that `s == 0`. There are no other modifications to `s` between this initialization and the loop entry point.

Therefore, when the loop condition is first evaluated, the invariant `s == 0` holds true. This satisfies the establishment requirement for an inductive invariant.

## f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved:**

Assume the invariant `s == 0` holds at the beginning of an arbitrary iteration, and assume the loop condition `unknown()` evaluates to true (so the iteration executes).

**Step-by-step preservation proof:**

1. **Entry state:** At the start of the iteration, by assumption, `s == 0`

2. **Conditional evaluation:** The loop body evaluates `if (s != 0)`
   - Since `s == 0` (by our assumption), the condition `s != 0` evaluates to `false`

3. **Branch taken:** Because the condition is false, the body of the if-statement (`s = s + 1`) is **not executed**

4. **Exit state:** Since no statement that modifies `s` was executed, `s` retains its value: `s == 0`

5. **Conclusion:** At the end of the iteration, `s == 0` still holds

This demonstrates that if the invariant is true at the start of an iteration and the loop continues, the invariant remains true at the end of that iteration. This satisfies the preservation requirement for an inductive invariant.

## g. Termination Analysis

**State of variables at loop termination:**

The loop terminates when the condition `unknown()` returns false (evaluates to 0).

At this point:
- `s = 0` (as proven by the invariant holding throughout all iterations)

**Why the invariant remains valid at termination:**

The loop invariant `s == 0` is preserved through every iteration of the loop (as shown in section f). The termination of the loop occurs due to the external condition `unknown()` becoming false, which does not affect the value of `s`.

Since:
1. The invariant held before the loop
2. The invariant was preserved through every iteration
3. No code executes that modifies `s` when the loop condition becomes false

The invariant `s == 0` remains true when the loop terminates. The termination condition `!unknown()` is independent of the variable `s`, so the loop can terminate at any time while maintaining `s == 0`.

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the post-condition:**

The provided post-condition is:
```c
assert s == 0;
```

**This post-condition is CORRECT.**

**Proof of correctness:**

When the loop terminates:
- The loop condition is false: `!unknown()`
- The loop invariant holds: `s == 0`

The post-condition states `s == 0`, which is exactly what the invariant guarantees.

**Formal reasoning:**

At termination, we have:
- Loop invariant: `s == 0`
- Negated loop condition: `!unknown()`

The conjunction of these two facts is: `s == 0 ∧ !unknown()`

The post-condition requires: `s == 0`

Since `s == 0` is directly part of our conjunction, it trivially implies the post-condition. The value of `unknown()` is irrelevant to the truth of `s == 0`.

Therefore, the invariant `s == 0`, combined with the loop's termination, directly proves the post-condition `s == 0`. The assertion will always succeed, and the code is formally verified as correct with respect to this specification.
