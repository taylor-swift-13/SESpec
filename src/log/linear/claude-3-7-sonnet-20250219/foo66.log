## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose and Intended Outcome**:  
  The loop iterates with `x` starting from 1 up to 100 inclusive. On each iteration, it updates `y` to be `100 - x`, then increments `x` by 1. Effectively, `y` tracks a decreasing sequence starting at `99` (when `x=1`) down to `0` (when `x=100`). The overall goal is to set `y` such that after the loop finishes, `y` is less than 100.

- **Loop Structure**:  
  - Loop condition: `while (x <= 100)`  
    The loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.

  - Loop body:  
    1. Assign `y = 100 - x`  
    2. Increment `x` (`x = x + 1`)

- **Relevant Variables**:  
  - `x`: loop index, integer starting at 1.  
  - `y`: integer variable assigned each loop iteration as `100 - x`.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We record `(x, y)` before the loop and at several points after iterations.

| Time                  | `x` | `y`          | Explanation                            |
|-----------------------|-----|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Before loop (initial) | 1   | `?` (input)  | `x` initialized to 1, `y` unknown   |
| After 1st iteration    | 2   | 100 - 1 = 99 | `y = 100-1=99`, then `x=2`           |
| After 2nd iteration    | 3   | 100 - 2 = 98 | `y = 98`, then `x=3`                  |
| After 3rd iteration    | 4   | 97           |                                      |
| After 4th iteration    | 5   | 96           |                                      |
| After 5th iteration    | 6   | 95           |                                      |

If we continue to the end:  
- After 100th iteration: `x=101`, `y = 100 - 100 = 0`  
- Loop ends because `x=101 > 100`.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition):**  
  `assert(y < 100);`  
  This means after the loop terminates, the program expects `y < 100`.

- **Can this be a Loop Invariant as is?**  
  - No. The verification goal `y < 100` cannot be the loop invariant by itself because:  
    - At the start of the loop (before first iteration), `y` is not set by the code, so `y < 100` may or may not hold.  
    - During iterations, `y` is explicitly assigned `100 - x`. For the first iteration, `y = 99`, satisfying `y < 100`.  
    - However, `y` could be greater or less during some states depending on how we position the invariant.  
  - Essentially, the post-condition holds true after (and including) certain iterations but is not necessarily true *before* the loop runs (when `y` is uninitialized or unknown).

- **Can the verification goal be modified to form a valid invariant?**  
  Yes.  
  Since `y = 100 - x` throughout the loop, and `x` increases from 1 to 101 (final), we can express the invariant in terms of `x` and `y`:  
  - The relationship `y = 100 - x` holds at every iteration.  
  - Importantly, since `1 <= x <= 101` during the loop and after, we can use `y = 100 - x` as the invariant, and from the bounds on `x` derive `y < 100`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant (natural language):**  
  "At the start of every iteration of the loop, the variable `y` is equal to `100 - x`, and `x` is an integer satisfying `1 <= x <= 101`."

- **Explanation why invariant is valid:**  
  - Initially, before the loop, `x=1`. On the first iteration, `y` is assigned `100 - 1 = 99`, so after the first iteration `y=100-x` holds.
  - On each iteration, `y` is assigned `100 - x` and then `x` is incremented.  
  - Thus, at the top of the loop for the next iteration, `y` still equals `100 - (x - 1)`. Accounting carefully for when assignments happen, we can formalize the invariant to hold at the loop’s entry point if we allow it's true *after* the initial assignment in the body.  
  - Since the loop increments `x` by 1 each iteration, `x` progresses from 1 to 101, ensuring `y = 100 - x` ranges from 99 down to -1 eventually, but the loop only runs while `x <= 100`, so `y` values remain `>= 0`.  
  - Therefore, this invariant captures both the relationship between `x` and `y` and the valid range of `x` values, making it true throughout the loop execution.

---

## e. Establishment

- **How is the invariant established?**  
  - Before the first iteration, `x=1`. `y` can be any initial value (input parameter), so the invariant `y = 100 - x` is not yet established *before* the loop body executes.
  - However, the invariant can be interpreted as holding *at the start of each loop iteration*, *after* the first assignment to `y` inside the loop body during the previous iteration or initial "setup" iteration.
  - More explicitly, the invariant holds after the first iteration completes: after iteration 1, `y = 99` and `x = 2`, thus `y = 100 - (x - 1)`.
  - Hence, the invariant holds at the loop header (start of each iteration) from the second iteration onwards.
  - Since the first iteration assigns `y=100 - 1` and increments `x=2`, the property is thus *established* at loop entrance for subsequent iterations.

---

## f. Preservation

- **How is the invariant preserved?**  
  Assume at the start of an iteration that the invariant holds:  
  - `y = 100 - (x - 1)` (we adjust because the assignment in the previous iteration relates to the previous `x`)  
  - `x` satisfies `1 <= x <= 100`.

  During the iteration:  
  - `y` is set to `100 - x`.  
  - Then `x` is incremented by 1.

After the iteration:  
- The new value of `x` is `x + 1`.  
- The invariant for the *next* iteration's start is:  
  `y = 100 - (x_new - 1)` where `x_new = x + 1`.

By substituting:  
- Just before starting the next iteration, `y = 100 - x` (from the current iteration), and the new `x` is `x + 1`.  
- Hence,  
  ```
  y = 100 - x
  x_new = x + 1
  y = 100 - (x_new - 1)  // invariant form for next iteration
  ```
- So the invariant is preserved.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- **When loop terminates:**  
  The loop condition is `x <= 100`. The loop terminates when `x > 100`, i.e., when `x=101`.

- **Variables at termination:**  
  After the last iteration where `x=100`:  
  - `y = 100 - 100 = 0` (last assignment inside the loop body),  
  - `x` increments to 101, so loop exits.

- **Validity of invariant at termination:**  
  The invariant `y = 100 - (x - 1)` still holds considering the last loop execution:  
  - At termination start: `x=101` (loop condition false)  
  - Then check `y = 100 - (x - 1) = 100 - 100 = 0`, which matches the last assigned `y`.

- Therefore, the invariant remains valid at the point the loop terminates.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition:**  
  `assert(y < 100);`

- **Is it correct?**  
  Yes.

- **Why?**  
  Using the invariant and the termination condition:  

  - At termination, `x=101` (loop condition `x <= 100` is false).  
  - The invariant states `y = 100 - (x - 1)`, so substituting `x=101`:  
    `y = 100 - 100 = 0`.

  - Clearly, `0 < 100`, so `y < 100` holds.

- **How invariant + negation of loop condition imply post-condition:**  
  - Invariant: `y = 100 - (x - 1)`  
  - Negation of loop condition: `x > 100`  
  - So,  
    `y = 100 - (x - 1) < 100` since `(x-1) >= 100`.  
  - This satisfies the post-condition `y < 100`.

---

# **Summary**

### Complete Loop Invariant (formalized):

```c
/*@
  Loop invariant: y = 100 - (x - 1) && 1 <= x <= 101;
*/
```

- Holds at the start and end of every iteration (from the second iteration onwards).  
- Establishes a direct relationship between `x` and `y` inside the loop.  
- Preserved by the loop body: each iteration assigns `y=100-x` and increments `x`.  
- At loop termination (`x=101`), the invariant shows `y=0`, which guarantees the post-condition `y < 100`.

- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == 1) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo66(int y) {
    int x = 1;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  ((x == 1)&&(y == \at(y,Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_y) ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (x <= 100) {
        y = 100 - x;
        x = x +1;
    }
            

    /*@ assert (y < 100); */

}`
