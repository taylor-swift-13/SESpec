## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop implements a non-deterministic counter that oscillates around the value `n`. It maintains a counter `c` that either increments toward `n` or resets to 1 when it reaches `n`, based on non-deterministic choices.

**Structure:**
- **Loop condition:** `unknown()` - a non-deterministic boolean function that controls loop execution
- **Loop body:** Contains two non-deterministic branches:
  - **First branch (if `unknown()` returns true):** If `c != n`, increment `c` by 1
  - **Second branch (else):** If `c == n`, reset `c` to 1
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `n`: A positive integer constant (from precondition: `n > 0`)
  - `c`: Counter variable, initialized to 0 before the loop
  - `v1, v2, v3`: Unused parameters (not relevant to loop behavior)

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let's trace with concrete example: `n = 3`

**Pre-Loop Sample (Iteration 0):**
- `c = 0`
- `n = 3`

**Post-Iteration Sample 1:**
- If first branch taken with `c != n` condition true: `c = 0 + 1 = 1`
- If second branch taken with `c == n` condition false: `c = 0` (no change)
- **Most likely state:** `c = 1` (since `c = 0 != 3`)

**Post-Iteration Sample 2:**
- Starting from `c = 1`
- If first branch with `c != n`: `c = 1 + 1 = 2`
- If second branch with `c == n` (false): no change
- **Most likely state:** `c = 2`

**Post-Iteration Sample 3:**
- Starting from `c = 2`
- If first branch with `c != n`: `c = 2 + 1 = 3`
- If second branch with `c == n` (false): no change
- **Most likely state:** `c = 3`

**Post-Iteration Sample 4:**
- Starting from `c = 3`
- If first branch with `c != n` (false): no change, `c = 3`
- If second branch with `c == n` (true): `c = 1`
- **Possible states:** `c = 3` or `c = 1`

**Post-Iteration Sample 5:**
- Starting from `c = 3` or `c = 1`
- From `c = 1`: first branch gives `c = 2`
- From `c = 3`: second branch gives `c = 1`
- **Possible states:** `c = 1, 2, 3`

**Post-Loop Sample:**
- When loop terminates (when `unknown()` returns false), `c` can be any value in range `[1, n]`
- With our example: `c ∈ {1, 2, 3}`

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
```c
(c != n) ==> (c <= n)
```
This states: "If `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n`."

**Can the verification goal serve as a loop invariant?**

**NO.** The verification goal cannot be directly used as the loop invariant for the following reasons:

1. **The invariant is too weak:** The verification goal only constrains `c` when `c != n`, but says nothing about the case when `c == n`. An invariant needs to describe the complete state space.

2. **The invariant doesn't capture the lower bound:** From our sampling, we see that after the loop starts, `c` is always at least 1 (or 0 initially). The verification goal doesn't capture this lower bound relationship.

3. **The verification goal is actually a tautology in the context:** If we only know `c != n`, the implication `c <= n` alone doesn't tell us enough. We need to know that `c` is in the range `[0, n]` or `[1, n]` depending on iteration state.

**Modification to Create Valid Invariant:**

The verification goal needs to be strengthened to:
```
0 <= c <= n
```

**Why this modification works:**

- **Establishment:** Initially `c = 0`, and we have `n > 0` from precondition, so `0 <= 0 <= n` holds.

- **Preservation:** 
  - When `c < n` and first branch executes: `c' = c + 1`, so `1 <= c' <= n`
  - When `c == n` and second branch executes: `c' = 1`, so `1 <= c' <= n`
  - In all cases: `0 <= c' <= n`

- **Termination:** When the loop exits with invariant `0 <= c <= n`, we have:
  - If `c != n`, then `c < n` (since `c <= n` and `c != n`)
  - Therefore `c <= n` holds, proving the post-condition

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**
"The counter `c` is always between 0 and `n` inclusive."

**Formal statement:**
```c
0 <= c <= n
```

**Why this invariant is valid:**

1. **It captures the complete state space:** The invariant bounds `c` from both above and below, covering all possible values `c` can take during execution.

2. **It holds at every sampled point:**
   - Pre-loop: `c = 0`, and `0 <= 0 <= n` ✓
   - Post-iteration 1-5: All sampled values (0, 1, 2, 3) satisfy `0 <= c <= 3` ✓
   - The invariant accounts for both loop operations:
     - Increment operation keeps `c` from exceeding `n`
     - Reset operation brings `c` back to 1, which is within bounds

3. **It's preserved by all loop operations:**
   - The increment only occurs when `c != n`, preventing `c` from exceeding `n`
   - The reset only occurs when `c == n`, and resets to 1, which is within bounds

4. **It's strong enough to prove the post-condition:** Combined with loop termination, it implies the verification goal.

## e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established:**

**Initial state before loop:**
- `c` is initialized to `0`
- From the precondition: `n > 0`

**Verification of establishment:**
```
c = 0
n > 0  (from precondition)

Therefore: 0 <= c       (since c = 0)
           c <= n       (since 0 <= n, which follows from n > 0)

Thus: 0 <= c <= n holds before the first iteration
```

The precondition `n > 0` is crucial here because it guarantees that `n >= 1`, which means `0 <= n`, allowing the invariant to hold with the initial value `c = 0`.

## f. Preservation

**Proof that the invariant is preserved:**

**Assumption:** At the start of iteration `i`, the invariant holds: `0 <= c <= n`

**Case analysis of loop body:**

**Case 1: First branch taken (`unknown()` returns true in outer condition)**
- **Subcase 1a:** `c != n` (condition is true)
  - Operation: `c' = c + 1`
  - Since `0 <= c <= n` and `c != n`, we have `0 <= c < n`
  - Therefore: `1 <= c + 1 <= n`, so `0 <= c' <= n` ✓
  
- **Subcase 1b:** `c == n` (condition is false)
  - Operation: No change, `c' = c`
  - Since `0 <= c <= n` holds, it continues to hold: `0 <= c' <= n` ✓

**Case 2: Second branch taken (outer `unknown()` returns false)**
- **Subcase 2a:** `c == n` (condition is true)
  - Operation: `c' = 1`
  - Since `n > 0` (from precondition), we have `n >= 1`
  - Therefore: `0 <= 1 <= n`, so `0 <= c' <= n` ✓
  
- **Subcase 2b:** `c != n` (condition is false)
  - Operation: No change, `c' = c`
  - Since `0 <= c <= n` holds, it continues to hold: `0 <= c' <= n` ✓

**Conclusion:** In all possible execution paths through the loop body, if `0 <= c <= n` holds at the start, it holds at the end. Therefore, the invariant is preserved.

## g. Termination Analysis

**Loop termination condition:**
The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false (the loop condition becomes false).

**State of variables at termination:**
- `n`: Unchanged throughout execution, still satisfies `n > 0`
- `c`: Some value in the range `[0, n]` (from the invariant)
- More specifically, `c` is in `[1, n]` unless the loop never executes (in which case `c = 0`)

**Why the invariant remains valid at termination:**

The loop invariant `0 <= c <= n` is preserved through every iteration (as shown in section f). When the loop terminates, it does so by the `unknown()` function returning false, which doesn't modify any variables. Therefore, whatever value `c` had at the end of the last iteration (which satisfied `0 <= c <= n`) is the value it has when the loop terminates.

**Key observation:** The termination is independent of the program variables - it depends only on the non-deterministic `unknown()` function. This means termination can occur at any point where the invariant holds, and the invariant will still hold at termination.

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Given post-condition:**
```c
(c != n) ==> (c <= n)
```

**Is the post-condition correct? YES.**

**Proof of correctness:**

When the loop terminates, we have:
1. Loop invariant holds: `0 <= c <= n`
2. Loop has terminated: `unknown()` returned false (but this doesn't constrain `c`)

**To prove:** `(c != n) ==> (c <= n)`

**Proof by cases:**

**Case 1:** `c == n`
- The antecedent `(c != n)` is false
- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true
- Therefore: `(c != n) ==> (c <= n)` holds ✓

**Case 2:** `c != n`
- From the invariant: `0 <= c <= n`
- Since `c != n` and `c <= n`, we must have `c < n`
- Therefore: `c <= n` is true
- The implication `(c != n) ==> (c <= n)` holds ✓

**Conclusion:** The post-condition is correct. The loop invariant `0 <= c <= n`, combined with basic logical reasoning, is sufficient to prove the post-condition `(c != n) ==> (c <= n)` regardless of how the loop terminates.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-22 21:43:04,946 - DEBUG  -  Looking at this C program, I need to analyze the loop behavior and fill in the placeholders for the loop invariant.

**Analysis:**
- Initial state: `c = 0`, and `n > 0` from precondition
- Loop body has two branches:
  - If `c != n`: increment `c` by 1
  - If `c == n`: reset `c` to 1
- Variables `v1, v2, v3, n` are never modified in the loop
- Variable `c` starts at 0 and can evolve to values in range `[1, n]` after the first iteration

**Key observations:**
1. After any iteration (if the loop executes at least once), `c` will be in range `[1, n]`
2. The loop maintains `c <= n` because:
   - When `c < n`, it can increment to at most `n`
   - When `c == n`, it resets to 1
3. The existing invariants already capture that `v1, v2, v3, n` remain unchanged
4. The first invariant has a disjunction: either we're still at the initial state `(c == 0)` OR we've entered the loop and `c` is in range `[1, n]`

**For PLACE_HOLDER_c:**
After entering the loop at least once, `c` must satisfy `1 <= c <= n`

**For PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS:**
Only `c` is modified in the loop

    requires n > 0;
