---

## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**

The loop calculates the sum of all integers starting from `0` up to but not including `n`. More precisely, after the loop finishes, `sum` will hold the value:

\[
\text{sum} = 0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1)
\]

The function requires `n >= 0`, so it sums the first `n` non-negative integers excluding `n` itself.

---

**Structure:**

- **Loop condition:** `i < n`
- **Body operations per iteration:**
  - Update `sum` by adding the current value of `i`
  - Increment `i` by 1
- **Relevant variables:**
  - `i`: loop counter, starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each iteration
  - `sum`: accumulator, sums the values of `i` over iterations
  - `n`: loop bound, non-negative integer predicate parameter

The loop iterates exactly `n` times if `n > 0`, otherwise zero times if `n == 0`.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Initial values before loop:

| Variable | Value  |
|----------|---------|
| `i`      | 0       |
| `sum`    | 0       |
| `n`      | Given, ≥ 0   |

For samples, assume a concrete `n` value for illustration, say `n = 5`:

| Iteration | `i` (before iteration) | `sum` (before iteration) | `sum` (after iteration) | `i` (after iteration) |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Initial   | 0                     | 0                        | N/A                    | N/A                  |
| 1         | 0                     | 0                        | 0 + 0 = 0              | 1                    |
| 2         | 1                     | 0                        | 0 + 1 = 1              | 2                    |
| 3         | 2                     | 1                        | 1 + 2 = 3              | 3                    |
| 4         | 3                     | 3                        | 3 + 3 = 6              | 4                    |
| 5         | 4                     | 6                        | 6 + 4 = 10             | 5                    |

After the fifth iteration (`i = 5`), the loop condition `i < n` is false (5 < 5 is false), so loop terminates.

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification goal (post-condition):**

```c
/*@ assert sum >= 0; */
```

The post-condition states that after the loop completes, `sum` is non-negative.

---

**Can `sum >= 0` serve directly as a loop invariant?**

- **No.** While `sum >= 0` is true initially and after loop termination, it is a weak condition that alone is not sufficiently descriptive to capture the loop's progress or enable reasoning about correctness for all values of `n`.
- `sum >= 0` holds trivially due to summing non-negative integers, but it doesn't characterize the relationship of `sum` to `i` and `n`, which is needed to prove more meaningful properties (like potential correctness of summation).

---

**Can it be modified to a valid invariant?**

- Yes.
- We can strengthen the invariant to relate `sum` and `i` as:

\[
\texttt{sum} = \sum_{k=0}^{i-1} k = \frac{i \times (i-1)}{2}
\]

AND maintain

\[
0 \leq i \leq n
\]

- This invariant, if established and preserved, will:

  - Hold before the loop starts (`i=0`, `sum=0`).
  - Hold after each iteration (incrementing `i` and updating `sum` accordingly).
  - At termination (`i == n`), imply the post-condition (`sum >= 0`) and also allows stronger correctness reasoning.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed loop invariant in natural language:**

> At the start of every loop iteration, the variable `sum` equals the sum of all integers from 0 up to `i - 1`,
> and `i` is always between 0 and `n` inclusive.

Formally:

```c
/*@
  0 <= i <= n
  && sum == (i * (i - 1)) / 2
@*/
```

---

**Why is this valid?**

- When the loop starts: `i=0`, and summation from 0 to -1 is 0, which matches `sum=0`.
- Each iteration adds the current `i` to `sum` and increments `i` by 1, maintaining the relationship.
- `i` never exceeds `n` because the loop stops as soon as `i == n`.
- This invariant ties the loop variables' values in a precise, mathematical relation that is true before and after each iteration, making it inductively invariant.

---

## e. Establishment

**How is the invariant established?**

- Before the loop begins:

  - `i = 0`
  - `sum = 0`
  - Precondition guarantees `n >= 0`

- Evaluating invariant at this point:

  - \(0 \leq 0 \leq n\) (since `n >= 0`)
  - sum = (0 * (0 - 1)) / 2 = (0 * (-1)) / 2 = 0

- This matches the initial value of `sum = 0`

- Hence the invariant holds true before the first iteration.

---

## f. Preservation

**How is the invariant preserved?**

Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration with current values `i` and `sum`:

\[
0 \leq i < n
\quad \text{and} \quad
sum = \frac{i \times (i-1)}{2}
\]

**During iteration:**

- `sum = sum + i;`

- `i = i + 1;`

We need to show that after these operations, the invariant holds for updated `i` and `sum`.

Calculate the new `sum` value:

\[
sum_{new} = sum + i = \frac{i \times (i - 1)}{2} + i = \frac{i \times (i - 1) + 2i}{2} = \frac{i^2 - i + 2i}{2} = \frac{i^2 + i}{2}
\]

The new `i` is:

\[
i_{new} = i + 1
\]

Substitute \(i_{new} = i + 1\) into the invariant formula:

\[
\frac{i_{new} \times (i_{new} - 1)}{2} = \frac{(i + 1) \times (i + 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{(i+1) \times i}{2} = \frac{i^2 + i}{2}
\]

Which is exactly `sum_new` calculated above.

Also, since previous \(i < n\), incremented \(i_{new} = i + 1 \leq n\).

Thus:

\[
0 \leq i_{new} \leq n
\quad \text{and} \quad
sum_{new} = \frac{i_{new} \times (i_{new} - 1)}{2}
\]

So the invariant holds after the iteration.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

Loop terminates when:

\[
i \geq n
\]

Due to loop condition `i < n`, termination implies:

\[
i = n
\]

At termination, the invariant states:

\[
sum = \frac{n \times (n-1)}{2}
\]

and

\[
0 \leq n \leq n
\]

which is trivially true.

Thus the invariant remains valid at termination.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

Provided post-condition:

```c
/*@ assert sum >= 0; */
```

- This condition is **correct** and valid due to:

  - Since `n >= 0`, and sum is the sum of first `n` natural numbers (excluding `n`), sum is at least zero.

- Using invariant and termination condition:

  \[
  sum = \frac{n \times (n-1)}{2}
  \]

  - For \(n \geq 0\), this value is always \(\geq 0\).

Therefore:

\[
\text{invariant} \wedge \neg(\text{loop condition}) \Rightarrow sum \geq 0
\]

which proves the post-condition.

---

# **Summary of the Loop Invariant to Fill**

```c
/*@
  0 <= i <= n
  && sum == (i * (i - 1)) / 2
@*/
```

This invariant precisely characterizes the behavior of the loop variables before and after each iteration, is established at loop start, preserved during each iteration, and implies the correctness of the post-condition on loop termination.

---

2025-12-22 22:52:34,842 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) >= 0 && (sum == 0) * (i == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires n >= 0;
    */
    
void foo269(int n) {

    int i;
    int sum;

    sum = 0;
    i = 0;
