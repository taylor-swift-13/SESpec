---

### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**

- The loop iterates over the integer variable `x` starting from 1, incrementing `x` by 1 in every iteration, until `x` reaches `n`.
- Inside the loop, there is a conditional update of variable `m`: if the function `unknown()` returns true, `m` is set to the current value of `x`.
- Thus, the loop purpose is to traverse all integers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`, potentially updating `m` multiple times when `unknown()` triggers.
- The outcome after the loop is to have `m` hold some value related to the iterations where `unknown()` was true — at minimum, since `m` started at 1, it will be at least 1.

**Loop structure:**

- Governing condition: `while (x < n)`
  - The loop continues as long as `x` is strictly less than `n`.
- Variables:
  - `x`: initialized to 1 before the loop; serves as the loop counter, incremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `m`: initialized to 1; conditionally updated inside the loop when `unknown()` returns true.
- Loop body:
  - If `unknown()` returns true, assign `m = x`.
  - Increment `x` by 1.

---

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

We have:

- Initial state (pre-loop):
  - `x = 1`
  - `m = 1`
- At each iteration:
  - If `unknown()` is true, `m = x`
  - `x` increments by 1

Since `unknown()` is unknown and nondeterministic, we will consider the variable values symbolically and in terms of bounds rather than concrete values.

| Iteration | `x` (start of iteration) | `unknown()` triggers?  | `m` (after loop body)         | `x` (after increment) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 0 (pre)  | 1                        | N/A                   | 1 (initial)                   | 1                     |
| 1         | 1                        | yes/no (unknown)      | if yes: `m=1`, else `m=1`    | 2                     |
| 2         | 2                        | yes/no (unknown)      | if yes: `m=2` else prev `m`  | 3                     |
| 3         | 3                        | yes/no (unknown)      | if yes: `m=3` else prev `m`  | 4                     |
| 4         | 4                        | yes/no (unknown)      | if yes: `m=4` else prev `m`  | 5                     |
| 5         | 5                        | yes/no (unknown)      | if yes: `m=5` else prev `m`  | 6                     |

- Because `unknown()` can return true or false arbitrarily, the value of `m` can only increase or stay the same (never decrease), and is always at least 1.
- `x` increases by 1 each iteration, starting at 1, until `x == n` when the loop stops.

**Post-loop (if loop terminates before iteration 5):**

- When the loop exits, `x >= n`.
- `m` holds some value assigned during the loop or the initial 1 if `unknown()` never triggered.

---

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal given at the end of the function is:

```c
/*@ assert (n > 1) ==> (m >= 1); */
```

- This asserts: If `n` is greater than 1, then `m` is at least 1 at the end of the loop.

**Can this post-condition serve as an invariant?**

- **No**, the post-condition `m >= 1` is trivially true since `m` is initialized to 1 and only ever possibly updated to equal `x` values (which start at 1 and increase).
- However, `m >= 1` is **already true before the loop begins** (establishment) and remains true throughout (preservation).
- So it can serve as part of a loop invariant, but by itself it's very weak and trivial.

We can improve and specify a stronger invariant that captures:

- `m >= 1` always holds (since it is never decreased below 1).
- `1 <= m <= x` whenever the loop is running (because when `unknown()` triggers, `m` is assigned `x`).
- `x` is always between `1` and `n` inclusive during the loop.

---

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (in natural language):**

- At the start of every iteration:
  - `1 <= m <= x <= n`
  - `m` is equal to some previously encountered value of `x` for which `unknown()` returned true, or 1 if such a value has not occurred (initially `m = 1`).
  
**Why this invariant is valid:**

- `x` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, stopping when `x == n`. So `x` is always at least 1 and at most `n`.
- `m` starts at 1 and is only assigned values of `x` (which are >= 1 and <= n).
- Thus, `m` never decreases below 1.
- Because `m` only gets updated to current `x` under `unknown()`, `m` always corresponds to some previously seen `x` value (or the initial 1).
- Therefore, the invariant meaningfully relates `m` and `x` with the bounds `1 <= m <= x <= n`.

---

### e. Establishment

- Before the loop starts:
  - `x = 1`
  - `m = 1`
- Clearly, `1 <= m <= x` is `1 <= 1 <= 1` which is true.
- Also, `x <= n` must hold at loop entry for loop to execute (`x = 1 < n` for loop to run).
- So the invariant `1 <= m <= x <= n` holds immediately before the first iteration.

---

### f. Preservation

Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration:

- `1 <= m <= x < n`

During the iteration:

- Evaluate `if (unknown())`, if true: `m = x`, so `m` becomes equal to `x`.
- Else, `m` remains unchanged.
- Then `x` is incremented: `x = x + 1`

At iteration end:

- New `x` is now `x + 1`
- `m` is either old `m` or set to old `x` (which is less than `x + 1`)
- So:
  - `m <= x` (old) implies `m <= x` (old) < `x+1` (new)
  - If `m` updated to `x` (old), then `m = x` (old) < `x + 1`, so `m < x` (new)
- Therefore:
  - `1 <= m <= x <= n` still holds because `x + 1 <= n` if loop continues (loop condition)
- Thus the invariant is preserved.

---

### g. Termination Analysis

Loop terminates when:

- `x < n` is false
- So `x >= n`

Since `x` increments by 1 each time starting at 1, final `x == n` (because once `x == n`, `x < n` is false).

At termination:

- The invariant guarantees `1 <= m <= x`
- Since `x == n` at loop end:
  - `1 <= m <= n`
- This matches the invariant and final state.

---

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The post-condition is:

```c
(n > 1) ==> (m >= 1)
```

- This is correct since `m` is never less than 1, shown by the loop invariant.

How does the invariant with loop exit imply the post-condition?

- The invariant states: `1 <= m <= x`
- At loop exit, `x >= n` (in fact, `x == n`)
- Therefore, `m >= 1`
- Thus, `(n > 1) ==> (m >= 1)` holds trivially for all `n > 1` (and even for `n <= 1` the loop does not run).

---

## **Final Summary:**

**Loop Invariant (formalized):**

```c
/*@
  loop invariant 1 <= m <= x <= n;
@*/
```

- This invariant is:

  - **Established before loop**: true initially with `x = 1`, `m = 1`.
  - **Preserved per iteration**: maintained as `m` updates to current `x` or remains same, and `x` increments.
  - **Valid at termination**: when `x == n`, invariant ensures `m >= 1`.

- The post-condition `(n > 1) ==> (m >= 1)` directly follows from the invariant when the loop ends.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(m == 1) * (x == 1) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


void foo18(int n) {
    int x = 1;
    int m = 1;
    
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (1 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_x) ;
          loop invariant (1 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (((m == 1)&&(x == 1)&&(n == \at(n,Pre))) || (PLACE_HOLDER_m));
          loop invariant (!(1 < \at(n,Pre))) ==> ((m == 1)&&(x == 1)&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (x < n) {
        
        if (unknown()) {
            m = x;
        }
        
        x = x + 1;
    }
            
 
    /*@ assert (n > 1) ==> (m >= 1); */

}`

2025-12-22 23:32:35,445 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(m == 1) * (x == 1) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `
