## a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome**

- The loop iteratively increments both `x` and `y` by 10 on each iteration.
- The exact number of iterations is unknown (controlled by `unknown()`).
- Variables `x` and `y` start within the range `[0,10]` due to pre-conditions.
- After the loop finishes, there is an assertion claiming: If `x` is exactly 20, then `y` is not zero.
- The general purpose seems to be a repetitive shifting of `x` and `y` upwards by increments of 10, possibly reaching a threshold like `x == 20`.

**Loop Structure**

- Loop condition: `unknown()` — a nondeterministic or unspecified boolean function.
- Loop body:
  - `x = x + 10;`
  - `y = y + 10;`
- Variables involved: `x`, `y`.
- Variables `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` are unused here.
- The condition `unknown()` may terminate arbitrarily.

---

## b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Starting values due to pre-conditions:

- `x` in `[0,10]`
- `y` in `[0,10]`

Let's assume some sample values to understand behavior.

| Iteration | x value       | y value       |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Pre-loop  | x = x0 ∈[0,10]| y = y0 ∈[0,10]|
| 1         | x = x0 + 10   | y = y0 + 10   |
| 2         | x = x0 + 20   | y = y0 + 20   |
| 3         | x = x0 + 30   | y = y0 + 30   |
| 4         | x = x0 + 40   | y = y0 + 40   |
| 5         | x = x0 + 50   | y = y0 + 50   |

- Since iterations increment by 10 each time, values increase linearly.
- The loop can, in theory, run indefinitely (nothing prevents infinite looping).
- The termination state depends on when `unknown()` returns false.
- The assertion checks if `x == 20` then `y != 0`.
- Given increments by 10, `x == 20` can occur only if starting `x0` was `0` or `10` and `unknown()` returns false at the second iteration (after two increments).

---

## c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Post-Condition:**  
`assert (x == 20) ==> (y != 0);`

- This states: If `x` equals 20 after loop, then `y` is nonzero.
- Is this an invariant? Can it hold at the start and end of each iteration?

**Can this be a loop invariant?**

- **NO**, directly:
  - The condition `x == 20` typically will *not* be true except at particular iterations.
  - Moreover, the implication only applies if `x == 20`.
  - During iterations where `x` is different (e.g., 10, 30, 40...), implication is vacuously true.
  - It only makes sense at termination or at the point `x` equals 20.
- Therefore, the post-condition alone is not inductive—it only needs to hold at loop exit (when no further iterations occur), not necessarily at every iteration.

**Can we modify it into an invariant?**

- Since `x` and `y` are increased together by the same amount (10), their difference remains constant.
- Define:

  ```
  INV: (x - y) == (x0 - y0)
  ```

- This invariant states that the difference between `x` and `y` remains unchanged through increments.
- This holds:
  - Before loop (establishment): `x - y == x0 - y0`.
  - After each iteration: `x+10 - (y+10) == (x - y)`, so preserved.
- Then at termination, combining the invariant with `(x == 20)` helps to reason about `y`.

**In summary:**

- The post-condition does not directly serve as an invariant.
- A useful invariant is the preservation of the difference `x - y` across loop iterations, which supports reasoning about `x == 20` implying something about `y`.

---

## d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Invariant (in natural language):**

- *"The difference between `x` and `y` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop, equal to its initial value before the loop starts."*

In formal notation (if modeling):

```
x - y == x0 - y0
```

where `x0` and `y0` are initial values of `x` and `y`.

**Why is this valid?**

- Each iteration increments both `x` and `y` by an equal amount (10).
- Therefore, the difference does not change.
- This remains true before the loop, after each iteration, and at loop termination.
- Enables reasoning about relations between `x` and `y` given any value of `x`.

---

## e. Establishment

- Initially, by pre-condition, `x` and `y` start with values `x0`, `y0` (where `x0 ∈ [0,10]`, `y0 ∈ [0,10]`).
- Initially, difference is `x0 - y0`.
- Before the first iteration, the invariant holds trivially because no changes have been made yet.

---

## f. Preservation

- Suppose the invariant holds at the start of an iteration:

  ```
  x - y == x0 - y0
  ```

- Loop body:

  ```
  x = x + 10;
  y = y + 10;
  ```

- Compute new difference after updates:

  ```
  (x + 10) - (y + 10) = x - y = x0 - y0
  ```

- Therefore, invariant remains true after one iteration.
- Since this applies to any iteration when loop condition holds, preservation is confirmed.

---

## g. Termination Analysis

- When the loop terminates, `unknown()` returns false.
- At this point variables satisfy:

  ```
  x - y == x0 - y0
  ```

- No changes occur since last iteration.
- Loop condition false implies loop no longer executes.
- The invariant still holds because it is maintained throughout.

---

## h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition to verify:**

```
(x == 20) ==> (y != 0)
```

- Using the invariant `x - y == x0 - y0`:

  If `x == 20`, then:

  ```
  y = x - (x0 - y0) = 20 - (x0 - y0) = 20 - x0 + y0
  ```

- Since `x0` and `y0` start in `[0,10]` and y0 ≥ 0:

  - At minimum, if `x0` is 10 and `y0` is 0:

    ```
    y = 20 - 10 + 0 = 10
    ```

  - So `y` cannot be zero when `x == 20` (since `y` at least 10 in this case).

- Even if `y0` started at zero, `y` will be increased by increments ensuring it's not zero at `x == 20`.

**Is the post-condition correct?**

- Yes, as long as the starting values satisfy pre-conditions and the invariant,
- `(x == 20)` implies `(y != 0)` holds.

**How the invariant and loop termination imply it:**

- The invariant relates `x` and `y` linearly.
- At termination, if `x == 20`, `y` can be computed and will be non-zero.
- So the assertion is sound with respect to the loop behavior.

2025-12-22 21:51:44,550 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) >= 0 && \at(x,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) >= 0 && (z3 == \at(z3,Pre)) * (z2 == \at(z2,Pre)) * (z1 == \at(z1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@

    */

2025-12-22 21:51:44,550 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) >= 0 && \at(x,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) >= 0 && (z3 == \at(z3,Pre)) * (z2 == \at(z2,Pre)) * (z1 == \at(z1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x >= 0 && x <= 10 && y <= 10 && y >= 0;
    */
    
void foo11(int x, int y,int z1,int z2,int z3) {
  
  
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_y ;
          loop invariant z3 == \at(z3,Pre);
          loop invariant z2 == \at(z2,Pre);
          loop invariant z1 == \at(z1,Pre);
          loop assigns PLACE_HOLDER_ASSIGNMENTS;
            */
            while (unknown()) {
      
        x = x + 10;
        y = y + 10;
    }
            

       /*@ assert (x == 20) ==>  (y != 0); */

- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) >= 0 && \at(x,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) <= 10 && \at(y,Pre) >= 0 && (z3 == \at(z3,Pre)) * (z2 == \at(z2,Pre)) * (z1 == \at(z1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`
