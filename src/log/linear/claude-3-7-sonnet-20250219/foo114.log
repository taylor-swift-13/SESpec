# a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and intended outcome:**

- The loop increments two integer variables, `x` and `sn`, by 1 for every iteration while the condition `unknown()` returns true.
- Since `unknown()` is an external function with unknown behavior, the loop may iterate zero or more times.
- After the loop terminates, the assertion states: if `sn` is not equal to `x`, then `sn` must be −1.
- Intuitively, the loop is counting iterations via both `x` and `sn` in parallel, so they always remain equal.
- The assertion could be interpreted to say: “If `sn != x` holds, that happens only if `sn` is −1” (which is impossible given code and initialization), so it seems the assertion reflects an invariant property that `sn` and `x` are always equal after the loop.

**Loop structure:**

- Governing condition: `while(unknown())`
  - Unknown number of iterations; function returns a boolean-like value.
- Variables relevant to loop behavior:
  - `x` initialized to 0 before loop: incremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `sn` initialized to 0 before loop: incremented similarly by 1 each iteration.
- Body:
  - `x = x + 1;`
  - `sn = sn + 1;`
- No other side effects.
- Variables `x` and `sn` are modified synchronously and identically each iteration.

---

# b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Define `x_i` and `sn_i` as the values of `x` and `sn` **after** iteration `i`.

- **Pre-Loop (before any iteration):**
  - `x = 0`
  - `sn = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Samples:**

| Iteration i | x after i-th iteration | sn after i-th iteration |
|-------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1           | 1                     | 1                      |
| 2           | 2                     | 2                      |
| 3           | 3                     | 3                      |
| 4           | 4                     | 4                      |
| 5           | 5                     | 5                      |

- Because both variables increment identically, after any iteration, `x == sn`.

- **Post-Loop (if terminates after `k` iterations):**

| Iteration k | x after loop termination | sn after loop termination |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| k           | k                        | k                         |

- So at loop termination, `x == sn == k`.

---

# c. Verification Goal Analysis

Verification goal (post-condition):

```c
assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);
```

- **Interpretation:** If `sn` is not equal to `x` after the loop, then `sn` must be −1.

- Given the loop behavior, `sn` and `x` are always incremented in lockstep with same initial value, thus they should always be equal after any number of iterations including zero.

- Therefore, the precondition and loop behavior imply `sn == x` always after the loop.

**Can the verification goal be part of the invariant?**

- The goal is about a relation between `sn` and `x` (inequality implies a specific value).

- Since **the variables start equal and remain equal**, the hypothesis `(sn != x)` should be false for all reachable states. Thus `(sn != x)` is always false after the loop.

- The implication `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)` is therefore **vacuously true** since the antecedent `(sn != x)` is false.

- This post-condition is thus trivially true after the loop, but is **not an invariant because `sn != x` never holds during loop execution or after**.

- The verification goal is about a **post-condition**, not an inductive invariant.

**Modifying the verification goal to an invariant:**

- A natural invariant to propose is:  
  `sn == x`

- This is a strong equality invariant that holds from before loop starts (both zero), and is preserved by the loop increments.

- This invariant satisfies:

  - Establishment: true initially.
  
  - Preservation: increments both variables synchronously.
  
  - Termination: combined with negation of loop condition leads to post-condition (since `(sn != x)` is false under this invariant).

---

# d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed invariant (in natural language):**

> "At the start and end of every loop iteration, the variables `sn` and `x` are equal."

**Detailed explanation:**

- Initially, both `sn` and `x` are zero (equal).

- Each iteration increments both by exactly 1, preserving their equality.

- The loop condition does not modify variables or affect their relation.

- Therefore, at every state before and after an iteration, `sn == x`.

- This invariant holds no matter how many iterations occur.

---

# e. Establishment

- Before the loop begins, `sn = 0` and `x = 0`.

- Therefore, the invariant `sn == x` holds initially.

- The pre-condition given (`sn = 0, x = 0`) guarantees the invariant is true before entering the loop.

---

# f. Preservation

Assume the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration:

- `sn == x = k` for some integer `k`.

- The loop body executes:

  - `x = x + 1;` => `x = k + 1`

  - `sn = sn + 1;` => `sn = k + 1`

- At end of iteration, `sn == x == k + 1`.

- Thus, the invariant holds after the iteration.

- This reasoning applies regardless of the number of iterations.

---

# g. Termination Analysis

- The loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false.

- At that point, the invariant holds: `sn == x`.

- Since the invariant holds throughout, it still holds at termination.

---

# h. Post-condition Correctness

**Given post-condition:**

```c
assert (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);
```

**Evaluating correctness:**

- Since invariant guarantees `sn == x`, the predicate `(sn != x)` is false at termination.

- An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.

- Therefore, the post-condition always holds.

**Proving post-condition:**

- From loop invariant, `sn == x` at loop end.

- Negation of loop condition `(unknown() == false)`.

- Therefore, the condition `(sn != x)` is false.

- Thus, the implication `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)` is **true**.

| Aspect                 | Proposed/Observed                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Loop invariant         | `sn == x`                                         |
| Establishment          | Both initialized to 0 before the loop             |
| Preservation           | Both increment together by 1 each iteration       |
| Termination            | Invariant still holds when loop condition fails    |
| Post-condition         | `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)` holds vacuously       |
| Verification goal usage| Post-condition rather than invariant               |

# Final formal loop invariant annotation suggestion:

```c
/*@
  loop invariant sn == x;
  loop assigns sn, x;
  loop variant ???; // unknown(), no numeric variant is expressible here without more info
*/
while (unknown()) {
    x = x + 1;
    sn = sn + 1;
}
```
