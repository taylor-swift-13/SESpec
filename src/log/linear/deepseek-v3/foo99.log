#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop in `foo99(int n)` is designed to decrement `x` from its initial value `n` down to `0` while incrementing `y` from `0` up to `n`. The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, the sum of `x` and `y` should equal the initial value `n`. This is essentially a counting loop that transfers the value from `x` to `y`.

**Structure:**
- **Loop Condition:** `while (x > 0)`
- **Loop Body:**
  - `y = y + 1;` (increment `y` by 1)
  - `x = x - 1;` (decrement `x` by 1)
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: Starts at `n`, decremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `y`: Starts at `0`, incremented by 1 each iteration.
  - `n`: Initial value passed to the function, remains unchanged.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Assume `n = 5` for the sampling:

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
   - `x = 5`, `y = 0`, `n = 5`

2. **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
   - After 1st iteration: `x = 4`, `y = 1`
   - After 2nd iteration: `x = 3`, `y = 2`
   - After 3rd iteration: `x = 2`, `y = 3`
   - After 4th iteration: `x = 1`, `y = 4`
   - After 5th iteration: `x = 0`, `y = 5`

3. **Post-Loop Sampling:**
   - Loop terminates after 5 iterations (`x = 0`).
   - Final values: `x = 0`, `y = 5`, `n = 5`

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `n == x + y`

**Can the verification goal be used as an invariant?**
- **NO**, because the verification goal is only true at termination, not during iterations. For example:
  - Before the loop: `x + y = 5 + 0 = 5 == n` (true).
  - After 1st iteration: `x + y = 4 + 1 = 5 == n` (true).
  - However, if we consider the loop invariant must hold at the start and end of every iteration, the verification goal can actually serve as an invariant in this case because `x + y` remains equal to `n` throughout all iterations.

**Proposed Invariant:**
- `x + y == n`

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Loop Invariant:** `x + y == n`

**Explanation:**
- The invariant `x + y == n` holds true:
  - Before the loop starts (`x = n`, `y = 0` ⇒ `n + 0 == n`).
  - At the end of each iteration (since `x` decreases by 1 and `y` increases by 1, their sum remains unchanged).
  - After the loop terminates (`x = 0`, `y = n` ⇒ `0 + n == n`).

#### e. Establishment

**Pre-condition:** `x == n && y == 0`

- The invariant `x + y == n` is established before the loop begins because:
  - `x` is initialized to `n`.
  - `y` is initialized to `0`.
  - Thus, `x + y = n + 0 = n`, satisfying the invariant.

#### f. Preservation

Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (`x + y == n`) and the loop condition is true (`x > 0`).

- **Start of iteration:** `x = x_old`, `y = y_old`, `x_old + y_old == n`.
- **Loop body:**
  - `y = y_old + 1`.
  - `x = x_old - 1`.
- **End of iteration:** `x + y = (x_old - 1) + (y_old + 1) = x_old + y_old = n`.
- Thus, the invariant is preserved.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination Condition:** `x <= 0` (negation of `x > 0`).

- At termination:
  - `x = 0` (since `x` is decremented by 1 each iteration and starts at `n`).
  - `y = n` (since `y` is incremented by 1 each iteration and starts at `0`).
  - Invariant holds: `0 + n == n`.

**Why the invariant remains valid:**
- The invariant `x + y == n` holds at termination because `x` has been fully decremented to `0` and `y` has been fully incremented to `n`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Provided Post-condition:** `n == x + y`

- **Correctness:** The post-condition is correct.
  - From the invariant `x + y == n` and termination condition `x <= 0`, we know `x = 0` at termination.
  - Thus, `0 + y == n` ⇒ `y == n`.
  - Therefore, `x + y = 0 + n = n`, satisfying the post-condition.

### Final Answer

The loop invariant `x + y == n` is valid because:
1. It holds before the loop starts (`x = n`, `y = 0` ⇒ `n + 0 == n`).
2. It is preserved in each iteration (decrementing `x` and incrementing `y` keeps the sum constant).
3. At termination (`x = 0`), it implies `y == n`, satisfying the post-condition `n == x + y`.

Thus, the loop is correctly verified with the invariant `x + y == n`.

The loop invariant `x + y == n` satisfies:
1. **Establishment**: Holds initially since `x = n` and `y = 0` (from pre-condition)
2. **Preservation**: Maintained because `x` decreases by 1 while `y` increases by 1 each iteration
3. **Termination**: When loop exits (`x == 0`), implies `y == n` which proves the post-condition

The `loop assigns` clause specifies that only `x` and `y` are modified by the loop.

2025-12-27 19:10:31,830 - DEBUG  - Here is the complete C code with the loop invariants filled in according to the requirements:

```c
void foo99(int n) {
    int x = n;
    int y = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (x + y == \at(n,Pre));
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (x >= 0 && y <= \at(n,Pre));
      loop invariant (!(\at(n,Pre) > 0)) ==> ((y == 0)&&(x == \at(n,Pre))&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
      loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
      loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while (x > 0) {
      y = y + 1;
      x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert n == x + y; */
}
```

The invariants satisfy:
1. For positive n: maintains the key relationship x + y = initial n and bounds on x/y
2. For non-positive n: preserves the initial conditions
3. Always maintains n's initial value
4. Specifies exactly which variables are modified

The `loop assigns` clause correctly identifies x and y as the only modified variables. This satisfies all the given constraints while providing comprehensive verification of the loop's behavior.

2025-12-27 19:10:42,784 - DEBUG  - ```c

      y = y + 1;
      x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert n == x + y; */
}
```

The verification goal `n == x + y` is used directly as the first loop invariant since it holds throughout the loop's execution. Additional invariants specify:
1. The verification goal relationship
2. Bounds on x (decreasing from n to 0)
3. Bounds on y (increasing from 0 to n)
4. Special case when n is non-positive
5. Constancy of n
6. Variables modified by the loop

This satisfies all requirements while providing comprehensive verification of the loop's behavior.
