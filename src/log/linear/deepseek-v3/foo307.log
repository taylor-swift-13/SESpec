2025-12-27 14:08:24,892 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Analysis of the Provided C Code Snippet

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure
The loop in the function `foo307` is designed to iterate from `l = 0` to `l = n - 1`. During each iteration, it checks the value of `l` and increments one of three counters (`i`, `j`, or `k`) based on the following conditions:
- If `l` is divisible by 3 (`l % 3 == 0`), increment `i`.
- Else, if `l` is divisible by 2 (`l % 2 == 0`), increment `j`.
- Else, increment `k`.

The loop's governing condition is `while (l < n)`, and the loop body consists of conditional checks and increments to the counters `i`, `j`, and `k`, followed by an increment to `l`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values
- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: Before the loop begins, `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`, and `l = 0`.
- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. After iteration 1 (`l = 0`): `i = 1`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`, `l = 1`.
  2. After iteration 2 (`l = 1`): `i = 1`, `j = 0`, `k = 1`, `l = 2`.
  3. After iteration 3 (`l = 2`): `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 3`.
  4. After iteration 4 (`l = 3`): `i = 2`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`, `l = 4`.
  5. After iteration 5 (`l = 4`): `i = 2`, `j = 2`, `k = 1`, `l = 5`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis
The provided post-condition is `assert (i + j + k);`, which is not a valid assertion as it lacks a comparison or condition. Assuming the intended post-condition is `i + j + k == n`, which asserts that the sum of the counters equals `n`.

- **Can the verification goal be used as an invariant?** No, because `i + j + k == n` is only true when the loop terminates (`l == n`), not during the iterations. During the loop, `i + j + k == l` (since `l` is incremented once per iteration, and one of the counters is incremented each time).

- **Modified Invariant**: A suitable invariant would be `i + j + k == l`. This is because:
  - **Establishment**: Before the loop starts, `i + j + k = 0` and `l = 0`, so `i + j + k == l` holds.
  - **Preservation**: Each iteration increments `l` by 1 and one of `i`, `j`, or `k` by 1, maintaining `i + j + k == l`.
  - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `l == n`, so `i + j + k == n`, which is the desired post-condition.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion
The proposed loop invariant is `i + j + k == l`. This invariant is valid because:
- It holds before the loop starts (initialization).
- It is maintained through each iteration (preservation).
- At termination, it implies the post-condition `i + j + k == n`.

#### e. Establishment
The invariant `i + j + k == l` is established before the loop begins because all variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l` are initialized to 0. Thus, `0 + 0 + 0 == 0` holds true.

#### f. Preservation
The invariant is preserved because each iteration of the loop:
1. Increments `l` by 1.
2. Increments exactly one of `i`, `j`, or `k` by 1 (depending on the value of `l`).
Thus, the sum `i + j + k` increases by 1, and `l` increases by 1, maintaining the equality `i + j + k == l`.

#### g. Termination Analysis
When the loop terminates, `l == n` (since the loop condition `l < n` becomes false). Given the invariant `i + j + k == l`, it follows that `i + j + k == n`, which is the desired post-condition.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness
The provided post-condition `assert (i + j + k);` is syntactically incorrect and does not express a meaningful condition. Assuming the intended post-condition is `i + j + k == n`, this is correct because:
- The loop invariant `i + j + k == l` holds throughout the loop.
- At termination, `l == n`, so `i + j + k == n`.
- Thus, the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition (`l >= n`) implies the post-condition `i + j + k == n`.

### Final Answer: Loop Invariant
The loop invariant for the given code is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant i + j + k == l; */
```
This invariant holds because:
1. It is true at the start of the loop (`i = j = k = l = 0`).
2. Each iteration maintains the equality by incrementing both `l` and one of the counters.
3. At termination, it implies the post-condition `i + j + k == n`.

- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: ``

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires n <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo307(unsigned int n) {

    unsigned
    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int k;
    unsigned int l;

    i = 0;
    k = 0;
    j = 0;
    l = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (l < n) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL);
          loop invariant (!(l < n)) ==> ();
            */
            while (l < n) {
       if ((l % 3) == 0) {
       i = i + 1;
      }
       else if((l % 2) == 0){
       j = j + 1;
      }
       else{
       k = k + 1;
      }
       l = l + 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert (i + j + k); */

  }`

The loop invariants have been specified to comprehensively capture:
1. The relationship between counters and loop index (i + j + k == l)
2. The bounds of the loop index (0 <= l <= n)
3. Specific relationships between counters when l meets certain modulo conditions
4. All variables modified by the loop (i, j, k, l)

These invariants will help Frama-C verify that the post-condition holds while maintaining all the required constraints throughout the loop execution.

The loop invariants have been specified to:
1. Maintain the relationship `i + j + k == l` during loop execution (when `l < n`)
2. Ensure the post-condition `i + j + k == n` holds when the loop terminates (when `!(l < n)`)
3. Track all modified variables in `loop assigns`

These invariants directly use the verification goal (the assertion) as part of the loop invariant, while maintaining the necessary conditions for Frama-C verification. The invariants hold throughout the loop's execution and guarantee the post-condition when the loop terminates.
