---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop increments two variables, `x` and `sn`, by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero value (i.e., the loop condition is non-deterministic).  
- **Intended Outcome**: After the loop terminates, the post-condition asserts that if `sn` is not `-1`, then `sn` must equal `x`.  
- **Structure**:  
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (unknown())` (terminates when `unknown()` returns `0`).  
  - **Loop Body**:  
    - `x = x + 1`  
    - `sn = sn + 1`  
  - **Relevant Variables**:  
    - `x`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration.  
    - `sn`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration (mirrors `x`).  

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

| Iteration | `x` (before) | `sn` (before) | `x` (after) | `sn` (after) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Pre-Loop  | 0            | 0             | -           | -            |
| 1         | 0            | 0             | 1           | 1            |
| 2         | 1            | 1             | 2           | 2            |
| 3         | 2            | 2             | 3           | 3            |
| 4         | 3            | 3             | 4           | 4            |
| 5         | 4            | 4             | 5           | 5            |

- **Post-Loop Sampling (if applicable)**:  
  - If the loop terminates after `n` iterations, `x = n` and `sn = n`.  

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Verification Goal (Post-Condition)**:  
  ```c
  /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
  ```
  - This asserts that if `sn` is not `-1`, then `sn` must equal `x`.  

- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**  
  - **NO**, because the verification goal is only required to hold **after** the loop terminates. During execution, the loop condition (`unknown()`) may still be true, but the post-condition is not necessarily true at every iteration.  

- **Modified Invariant**:  
  - A suitable invariant is:  
    ```c
    /*@ loop invariant sn == x; */
    ```
  - **Justification**:  
    - **Establishment**: Before the loop, `sn = 0` and `x = 0`, so `sn == x` holds.  
    - **Preservation**: In each iteration, both `sn` and `x` are incremented by `1`, so `sn == x` remains true.  
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `sn == x` still holds, which implies the post-condition (`sn != -1 ==> sn == x`).  

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed Invariant**:  
  ```c
  /*@ loop invariant sn == x; */
  ```
- **Explanation**:  
  - The invariant `sn == x` is **always true** because:  
    - Before the loop: `sn = x = 0`.  
    - After each iteration: Both `sn` and `x` are incremented by `1`, preserving equality.  
  - This ensures that when the loop terminates, `sn == x` holds, which satisfies the post-condition.  

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- Before the loop starts:  
  - `sn = 0` and `x = 0`.  
  - Thus, `sn == x` is true.  
- The invariant is **established** before the first iteration.  

---

#### **f. Preservation**

- **Assumption**: At the start of an iteration, `sn == x` holds.  
- **Loop Body Execution**:  
  - `x = x + 1` → `x` increases by `1`.  
  - `sn = sn + 1` → `sn` increases by `1`.  
- **Result**:  
  - Since both `sn` and `x` are incremented by the same amount, `sn == x` remains true.  
- The invariant is **preserved** across iterations.  

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- **Termination Condition**: `unknown()` returns `0`.  
- **Final State**:  
  - `sn = x = n` (where `n` is the number of iterations).  
- **Invariant Holds**:  
  - `sn == x` remains true at termination.  
- **Post-Condition Implication**:  
  - Since `sn == x`, the implication `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)` is trivially true (because `sn == x` is always true).  

---

#### **h. Post-Condition Correctness**

- **Given Post-Condition**:  
  ```c
  /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
  ```
- **Evaluation**:  
  - The post-condition is **correct** because:  
    - The loop invariant `sn == x` ensures that `sn` and `x` are always equal.  
    - If `sn != -1`, then `sn == x` must hold (which it always does).  
  - The invariant, combined with termination, guarantees the post-condition.  

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**

The correct loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant sn == x; */
```

This ensures that `sn` and `x` remain equal throughout the loop, which guarantees the post-condition `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)` upon termination.

        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
}
```

The loop invariants I've provided are:
1. `sn == x` - This maintains the relationship between the two variables throughout the loop
2. `x >= 0 && sn >= 0` - This ensures both variables remain non-negative, which is true from the pre-condition and preserved by the increments
3. `loop assigns sn, x` - Specifies which variables are modified by the loop

These invariants satisfy all the requirements:
- They hold initially (from the pre-condition)
- They are preserved by each iteration
- They are sufficient to prove the post-condition
- They don't use any prohibited constructs
- They work for any number of iterations (including zero)

        sn = (sn + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x); */
}
```

The loop invariants include:
1. The verification goal `(sn != -1) ==> (sn == x)` as the first invariant
2. The stronger invariant `sn == x` which implies the verification goal
3. The non-negativity conditions `x >= 0 && sn >= 0` which are maintained
4. The `loop assigns` clause specifying which variables are modified

This satisfies all requirements:
- Uses the verification goal directly as an invariant
- Maintains all necessary relationships
- Preserves all constraints through iterations
- Works for any number of iterations
- Complies with all the given rules
