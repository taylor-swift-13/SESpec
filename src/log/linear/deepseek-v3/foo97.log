#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure
The given code snippet defines a function `foo97` that takes an integer `x` as input. The function initializes three integer variables: `i = 0`, `j = 0`, and `y = 2`. The loop structure is as follows:

- **Loop Condition**: `while (i <= x)`
- **Loop Body**: 
  - Increment `i` by 1: `i = i + 1`
  - Increment `j` by `y`: `j = j + y`

The purpose of the loop is to iterate while `i` is less than or equal to `x`. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by the value of `y` (which is always 2 in this case). The intended outcome is not explicitly stated, but the post-condition assertion suggests that the function is checking whether `(y == 1) ==> (i == j)`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values
Let's sample the values of the variables at different points in the execution. Assume `x = 5` for this analysis.

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
   - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `y = 2`, `x = 5`

2. **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
   - After 1st iteration: `i = 1`, `j = 2`
   - After 2nd iteration: `i = 2`, `j = 4`
   - After 3rd iteration: `i = 3`, `j = 6`
   - After 4th iteration: `i = 4`, `j = 8`
   - After 5th iteration: `i = 5`, `j = 10`

3. **Post-Loop Sampling**:
   - After the loop terminates (when `i = 6`): `i = 6`, `j = 12`

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis
The verification goal (post-condition) is:
```c
assert (y == 1) ==> (i == j);
```
This asserts that if `y` is 1, then `i` must equal `j` at the end of the loop.

- **Can the verification goal be part of the loop invariant?**
  - No, because the verification goal is only relevant at the end of the loop (when `y == 1`). During the loop iterations, `y` is always 2, so the implication `(y == 1) ==> (i == j)` is vacuously true (since the antecedent is false). This does not provide useful information during the loop.

- **Modifying the verification goal to create a valid invariant**:
  - Since `y` is always 2 in this loop, the invariant should relate `i` and `j` in a way that is meaningful throughout the loop. Given that `j` is always `2 * i` (because `j` is incremented by 2 each time `i` is incremented by 1), a suitable invariant would be `j == 2 * i`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion
- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `j == 2 * i`
- **Explanation**:
  - At the start of the loop, `i = 0` and `j = 0`, so `j == 2 * i` holds.
  - In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` by 2, so if `j == 2 * i` held at the start of the iteration, it will also hold at the end of the iteration.
  - Thus, `j == 2 * i` is true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration, making it a valid loop invariant.

#### e. Establishment
- The invariant `j == 2 * i` is established before the loop begins because:
  - `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0.
  - `2 * 0 == 0`, so the invariant holds.

#### f. Preservation
- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `j == 2 * i`.
- In the loop body:
  - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
  - `j` is updated to `j + 2`.
- After the update:
  - `j_new = j_old + 2 = 2 * i_old + 2 = 2 * (i_old + 1) = 2 * i_new`.
- Thus, the invariant `j == 2 * i` is preserved.

#### g. Termination Analysis
- The loop terminates when `i > x`.
- At termination:
  - `i = x + 1` (since `i` was incremented to `x + 1` to make `i <= x` false).
  - `j = 2 * (x + 1)` (from the invariant).
- The invariant `j == 2 * i` still holds at termination, as `i = x + 1` and `j = 2 * (x + 1)`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness
- The post-condition is:
  ```c
  assert (y == 1) ==> (i == j);
  ```
- Given that `y` is always 2 in this function, the implication `(y == 1) ==> (i == j)` is vacuously true (since `y == 1` is false). Thus, the post-condition is technically correct but not meaningful in this context.
- If `y` were 1, the loop would increment `j` by 1 each time, making `j == i` at the end of the loop, satisfying the post-condition. However, since `y` is hardcoded to 2, the post-condition is trivially satisfied.

### Final Answer
The loop invariant `j == 2 * i` is valid because:
1. It holds at the start of the loop (`i = 0`, `j = 0`).
2. It is preserved in each iteration (updating `i` by 1 and `j` by 2 maintains the relationship).
3. It holds at loop termination (`i = x + 1`, `j = 2 * (x + 1)`).

The post-condition `(y == 1) ==> (i == j)` is correct but trivial in this context, as `y` is always 2. If `y` were 1, the invariant would need to be adjusted to `j == i` to satisfy the post-condition.

Key points about the invariants:
1. For the case when `0 <= x` (normal execution):
   - `i <= x + 1` ensures `i` doesn't exceed bounds
   - `j == 2 * i` captures the exact relationship between `i` and `j`
   - `i >= 0 && j >= 0` maintains non-negativity

2. For the case when `!(0 <= x)` (empty loop):
   - Maintains all initial conditions exactly

3. Common invariants:
   - `y == 2` remains constant
   - `x == \at(x,Pre)` remains constant
   - `loop assigns` specifies only `i` and `j` are modified

The invariants are comprehensive while respecting all the given rules and constraints.

Key points about the invariants:
1. The verification goal `(y == 1) ==> (i == j)` is used directly as the first invariant when `0 <= x`
2. Additional invariants maintain:
   - Bounds on `i` (`i <= x + 1`)
   - Exact relationship between `i` and `j` (`j == 2 * i`)
   - Initial conditions when `!(0 <= x)`
   - Constant values of `y` and `x`
3. The `loop assigns` clause correctly specifies which variables are modified
4. All invariants are equality-based and comprehensive while respecting all given rules
