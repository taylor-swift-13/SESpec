---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**  
- **Purpose**: The loop decrements both `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration until `x` becomes 0. The post-condition suggests that the loop's purpose is to establish a relationship between `i` and `j` (via `y` and `x`) such that if `y` is not zero after the loop, then `i` and `j` were not equal initially.  
- **Structure**:  
  - **Condition**: `while (x != 0)`  
  - **Body**: `x = x - 1; y = y - 1;`  
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` (initialized to `i`), `y` (initialized to `j`), `i`, `j`.  

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**  
Assume initial values:  
- **Pre-Loop**:  
  - Let `i = 3`, `j = 5` (example). Then `x = 3`, `y = 5`.  
- **Post-Iteration Samples**:  
  1. After 1st iteration: `x = 2`, `y = 4`.  
  2. After 2nd iteration: `x = 1`, `y = 3`.  
  3. After 3rd iteration: `x = 0`, `y = 2`.  
  4. Loop terminates (no further iterations).  
- **Post-Loop**: `x = 0`, `y = 2`.  

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**  
- **Post-condition**: `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)`.  
- **Can it be an invariant?** No, because:  
  - The post-condition depends on the loop terminating (`x = 0`), which is not true during iterations.  
  - During execution, `y` may be nonzero, but `i` and `j` are fixed, so the implication is not necessarily preserved mid-loop.  
- **Modified Invariant**:  
  - **Key Insight**: The loop preserves the difference between `y` and `x` (i.e., `y - x = j - i`).  
  - **Proposed Invariant**: `y - x == j - i`.  
  - **Establishment**: Before the loop, `x = i` and `y = j`, so `y - x = j - i` holds.  
  - **Preservation**: Each iteration decrements `x` and `y` by 1, so `y - x` remains unchanged.  
  - **Termination**: At termination (`x = 0`), `y = j - i`, so `y != 0` implies `j != i`.  

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**  
- **Invariant**: `y - x == j - i`.  
- **Validity**:  
  - Holds initially (`y - x = j - i`).  
  - Preserved because both `x` and `y` are decremented equally.  
  - At termination, it implies the post-condition: if `x = 0`, then `y = j - i`, so `y != 0` implies `j != i`.  

---

#### **e. Establishment**  
- Before the loop:  
  - `x = i` and `y = j` (from assignments).  
  - Thus, `y - x = j - i` holds trivially.  

---

#### **f. Preservation**  
- At start of iteration: Assume `y - x == j - i` and `x != 0`.  
- After iteration:  
  - `x' = x - 1`, `y' = y - 1`.  
  - Then `y' - x' = (y - 1) - (x - 1) = y - x = j - i`.  
- Thus, the invariant holds after the iteration.  

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**  
- **Termination Condition**: `x == 0`.  
- **Final State**:  
  - From invariant: `y - 0 == j - i` ⇒ `y = j - i`.  
  - If `y != 0`, then `j - i != 0` ⇒ `j != i`.  
- The invariant remains valid and implies the post-condition.  

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**  
- **Post-condition**: `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)`.  
- **Correctness**:  
  - At termination, `y = j - i` (from invariant).  
  - If `y != 0`, then `j - i != 0` ⇒ `i != j`.  
  - Thus, the post-condition is **correct** and provable from the invariant.  

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**  
The loop invariant is:  
```c
/*@ loop invariant y - x == j - i; */
```  
This captures the constant difference between `y` and `x` throughout the loop and ensures the post-condition holds.
