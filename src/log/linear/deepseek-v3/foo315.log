---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop increments three variables (`i`, `j`, and `k`) by `3` in each iteration until `i` reaches or exceeds `n`. The intended outcome is to ensure that `k` and `j` are equal after the loop terminates, as asserted by the post-condition `k == j`.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing condition**: `while (i < n)`.
  - **Body operations**: 
    - `i = i + 3`
    - `j = j + 3`
    - `k = k + 3`
  - **Relevant variables**: `i` (loop counter), `j`, `k` (tracked variables), and `n` (upper bound).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

Assume `n = 6` for illustration (since `n <= 20000001` is allowed by the pre-condition):

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
   - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`, `n = 6`.
2. **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
   - After iteration 1: `i = 3`, `j = 3`, `k = 3`.
   - After iteration 2: `i = 6`, `j = 6`, `k = 6`.
   - Loop terminates (since `i >= n`).
3. **Post-Loop Sampling**:
   - `i = 6`, `j = 6`, `k = 6`.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Verification goal (post-condition)**: `k == j`.
- **Can it be an invariant?** 
  - **YES**, because `k` and `j` are always incremented by the same value (`3`) in each iteration. Thus, `k == j` holds at the start, during, and end of every iteration.
- **No modification needed**: The goal itself is a valid invariant.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed invariant**: 
  - `k == j` (always true).
  - `i == j && i == k` (stronger invariant, since all variables are always equal).
- **Why valid?**:
  - Before the loop: `i = j = k = 0` (holds).
  - During the loop: All variables are incremented by `3` simultaneously (preserves equality).
  - After the loop: Equality still holds.

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- **Pre-loop state**: `i = j = k = 0`.
- **Invariant holds**: `k == j` is true (since `0 == 0`).
- **Guaranteed by pre-condition**: The pre-condition `n <= 20000001` ensures no overflow issues, but the invariant's establishment depends only on initial assignments, which are fixed.

---

#### **f. Preservation**

- **Assumption**: At the start of an iteration, `k == j` holds, and `i < n`.
- **After iteration**:
  - `i` becomes `i + 3`, `j` becomes `j + 3`, `k` becomes `k + 3`.
  - Since `k == j` before, `k + 3 == j + 3` after (invariant preserved).

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- **Termination condition**: `i >= n`.
- **State at termination**:
  - `i = j = k = 3 * m`, where `m` is the number of iterations.
  - The invariant `k == j` still holds.
- **Why valid?** The loop stops when `i >= n`, but the invariant is independent of `n`.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**

- **Post-condition**: `k == j`.
- **Correctness**:
  - The invariant `k == j` holds throughout.
  - At termination, the loop condition is false (`i >= n`), but the invariant still holds.
  - Thus, the post-condition is **correct**.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**

The loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant k == j; */
```

**Explanation**:
- Holds initially (`k = j = 0`).
- Preserved in each iteration (both increment by `3`).
- Implies the post-condition `k == j` at termination. 

No stronger invariant is needed for this specific post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.
