---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**  
- **Purpose**: The loop decrements `cl` and increments `p` until either `p` reaches 4 or `cl` becomes 0.  
- **Structure**:  
  - **Condition**: `while (p < 4 && cl > 0)`  
  - **Body**:  
    ```c
    cl = cl - 1;
    p = p + 1;
    ```
  - **Variables**:  
    - `p`: Counter incremented each iteration (starts at 0).  
    - `cl`: Decremented each iteration (initial value is `c`, but `c` is uninitialized; assume `cl = c` is intended).  
    - `c`: Uninitialized (likely meant to initialize `cl`; assume `c` is some input value).  

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**  
Assume `c = cl = 5` (since `cl` is uninitialized, we pick a value for illustration):  

| Iteration | Pre-Loop | After Iter 1 | After Iter 2 | After Iter 3 | After Iter 4 | After Iter 5 | Post-Loop |
|-----------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| `p`       | 0        | 1            | 2            | 3            | 4            | -            | 4         |
| `cl`      | 5        | 4            | 3            | 2            | 1            | -            | 0         |
| `c`       | 5        | 5            | 5            | 5            | 5            | -            | 5         |

- **Termination**: Loop exits after 4 iterations when `p == 4` (before `cl` reaches 0).  

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**  
- **Post-condition**: `(c >= 4) ==> (p == 4)`  
  - If `c` (initial `cl`) is ≥ 4, then `p` must be 4 when the loop ends.  
- **Can it be an invariant?**  
  - No, because `p == 4` is only true at termination, not during iterations.  
- **Modified Invariant**:  
  - `p + cl == c && p <= 4`  
  - **Establishment**: True initially (`p=0`, `cl=c` ⇒ `0 + c == c`).  
  - **Preservation**: Each iteration decrements `cl` and increments `p`, preserving `p + cl == c`.  
  - **Termination**: When loop ends, `p == 4` (if `c >= 4`) or `cl == 0` (if `c < 4`).  

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**  
- **Proposed Invariant**:  
  ```c
  /*@ loop invariant p + cl == c && p <= 4; */
  ```  
- **Explanation**:  
  - `p + cl == c`: The sum of `p` and `cl` remains constant (equal to initial `c`).  
  - `p <= 4`: Ensures `p` never exceeds 4 (loop condition `p < 4` breaks when `p == 4`).  

---

#### **e. Establishment**  
- Before the loop:  
  - `p = 0`, `cl = c` ⇒ `0 + c == c` holds.  
  - `p <= 4` holds since `p = 0`.  

---

#### **f. Preservation**  
- Assume `p + cl == c` and `p <= 4` hold at start of iteration.  
- After iteration:  
  - `p' = p + 1`, `cl' = cl - 1` ⇒ `p' + cl' = (p + 1) + (cl - 1) = p + cl = c`.  
  - `p' = p + 1 <= 4` (since `p < 4` from loop condition).  

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**  
- Loop exits when `p >= 4` or `cl <= 0`:  
  - If `c >= 4`: `p` reaches 4 first (since `cl` starts at `c >= 4`).  
  - If `c < 4`: `cl` reaches 0 first (e.g., `c = 3` ⇒ `p = 3`, `cl = 0`).  
- Invariant still holds: `p + cl == c` and `p <= 4`.  

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**  
- **Post-condition**: `(c >= 4) ==> (p == 4)`  
  - From invariant `p + cl == c` and termination (`p >= 4 || cl <= 0`):  
    - If `c >= 4`, loop exits when `p == 4` (since `cl > 0` until `p` hits 4).  
  - **Conclusion**: The post-condition is correct and provable from the invariant.  

---

### **Final Answer**  
The loop invariant is:  
```c
/*@ loop invariant p + cl == c && p <= 4; */
```  
This ensures the post-condition `(c >= 4) ==> (p == 4)` holds upon termination. The invariant is established initially, preserved per iteration, and implies the post-condition when combined with the loop exit condition.

The loop invariant `p + cl == c && p <= 4` satisfies:
1. Establishment: Initially `p = 0` and `cl = c`, so `0 + c == c` holds
2. Preservation: Each iteration decrements `cl` and increments `p`, maintaining the sum
3. Termination: When combined with the loop exit condition, it proves the post-condition

The `loop assigns` clause specifies that only `p` and `cl` are modified by the loop.

2. `0 <= p <= 4` bounds the counter
3. `cl >= 0` ensures non-negative values

Key points about the invariants:
1. The first invariant maintains that while the loop runs, if c >= 4 then the sum p + cl equals c and p doesn't exceed 4
2. The second invariant ensures that when the loop stops, if c >= 4 then p must be 4
3. The verification goal (assertion) is directly incorporated into both invariants
4. The loop assigns clause correctly specifies that only p and cl are modified
5. All invariants are expressed purely in terms of the current state variables without using \at or LoopEntry
6. The invariants are comprehensive enough to prove the post-condition while following all the given rules
