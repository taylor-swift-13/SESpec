2025-12-27 19:20:07,440 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from `0` up to the value of `n`. The loop ensures that `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration until `x` is no longer less than `n`. The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, `x` will be equal to `n` (assuming `n` is non-negative).

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x < n)`
- **Loop Body:** `x = (x + 1);`
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: The loop counter, initialized to `0` before the loop.
  - `n`: The upper bound for `x`, provided as an input to the function.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 0`
- `n` is some integer (value depends on the function call).

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
Assume `n >= 5` for the sake of sampling 5 iterations.

1. After iteration 1:
   - `x = 1`
2. After iteration 2:
   - `x = 2`
3. After iteration 3:
   - `x = 3`
4. After iteration 4:
   - `x = 4`
5. After iteration 5:
   - `x = 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
If `n = 5`, the loop terminates after the 5th iteration, and the final value of `x` is `5`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
`(n >= 0) ==> (x == n)`

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
No, the verification goal cannot serve as the loop invariant because it is only true at termination, not during the iterations. During the loop, `x` is always less than `n`, so `x == n` is false until the loop terminates.

**Modifying the Verification Goal to Create an Invariant:**
We can modify the verification goal to create a valid invariant. The invariant should capture the relationship between `x` and `n` that holds during the loop. A suitable invariant would be:
`0 <= x <= n`

This invariant:
1. **Establishment:** Holds before the loop starts (`x = 0` and `n` could be any integer, but the loop only runs if `x < n`, so `n` must be at least `1` if the loop runs at all).
2. **Preservation:** If `0 <= x <= n` and `x < n`, then after `x = x + 1`, `x` will still be `<= n` (since `x < n` implies `x + 1 <= n`).
3. **Termination:** When the loop terminates (`x >= n`), and given `x <= n` from the invariant, we have `x == n`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language):**
"At the start and end of every iteration, `x` is between `0` and `n` (inclusive), and `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration."

**Formal Invariant:**
`0 <= x <= n`

**Validity Explanation:**
- Before the loop starts, `x = 0`, so `0 <= x <= n` holds (assuming `n >= 0`, which is implied by the loop condition `x < n` and `x = 0`).
- In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `1`, but since the loop condition ensures `x < n`, `x + 1` will not exceed `n`.
- Thus, the invariant `0 <= x <= n` holds at the start and end of every iteration.

### e. Establishment

**How the Invariant is Established:**
Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to `0`. The loop condition `x < n` implies that `n` must be at least `1` (if `n <= 0`, the loop does not run, and `x` remains `0`). Thus, `0 <= x <= n` holds initially:
- `x = 0` satisfies `0 <= x`.
- If the loop runs, `n >= 1`, so `x = 0 <= n`.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
At the start of an iteration, assume `0 <= x <= n` and `x < n` (loop condition). The loop body increments `x` by `1`:
- Since `x < n`, `x + 1 <= n`.
- Since `x >= 0`, `x + 1 >= 1 >= 0`.
Thus, after the iteration, `0 <= x <= n` still holds.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State at Termination:**
The loop terminates when `x >= n`. From the invariant, we know `x <= n`. Thus, at termination:
- `x >= n` (from loop condition negation).
- `x <= n` (from invariant).
Therefore, `x == n`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Provided Post-condition:**
`(n >= 0) ==> (x == n)`

**Evaluation:**
The post-condition is correct. Here's why:
- If `n >= 0`:
  - If `n == 0`, the loop does not run (since `x = 0` is not `< 0`), so `x = 0 == n`.
  - If `n > 0`, the loop runs until `x == n` (from termination analysis).
- The invariant `0 <= x <= n` and the termination condition `x >= n` imply `x == n`.
Thus, the post-condition holds.

4. `loop assigns x`: Only x is modified by the loop

These invariants satisfy:
- Establishment: Hold initially (x=0, n unchanged from pre-state)
- Preservation: Maintained through each iteration
- Termination: When loop exits (x ≥ n), combined with invariants implies x == n

2025-12-27 19:20:49,106 - DEBUG  - Here is the complete C code with the loop invariants filled in:

```c
void foo102(int n) {
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> ((n >= 0) ==> (x <= n));
      loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre)) ==> (0 <= x <= \at(n,Pre));
      loop invariant (!(0 < \at(n,Pre))) ==> ((x == 0) && (n == \at(n,Pre)));
      loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x < n) {
        x = (x + 1);
    }
            
    /*@ assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == n); */
}
```

Key points about the invariants:

1. Verification goal as invariant: `(n >= 0) ==> (x <= n)` - This is the weakened form of the post-condition that holds during execution
2. Main invariant: `0 <= x <= \at(n,Pre)` - Tracks x's progress toward n
3. Zero-case invariant: When n ≤ 0, x remains 0 and n unchanged
4. Value preservation: `n == \at(n,Pre)` ensures n doesn't change

The invariants satisfy:
- Establishment: All hold initially (x=0, n unchanged)
- Preservation: Maintained through each x increment
- Termination: Combine to prove final assertion `x == n` when n ≥ 0

The verification goal is used directly in the first invariant (weakened to `x <= n` since equality only holds at termination). The other invariants provide the complete reasoning needed for verification.
