2025-12-27 10:05:47,313 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop is to decrement the value of `x` from its initial value `n` down to `0`. The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, `x` will be `0` if the initial value `n` was non-negative. This is essentially a countdown loop.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x > 0)` - The loop continues as long as `x` is greater than `0`.
- **Operations in the Body:** `x = x - 1;` - In each iteration, `x` is decremented by `1`.
- **Relevant Variables:** 
  - `n`: The initial value passed to the function, which is copied to `x`.
  - `x`: The loop counter that is decremented in each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Let’s assume `n = 5` for the sake of sampling:

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
   - `n = 5`, `x = 5` (since `x` is initialized to `n`).

2. **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
   - After iteration 1: `x = 4`
   - After iteration 2: `x = 3`
   - After iteration 3: `x = 2`
   - After iteration 4: `x = 1`
   - After iteration 5: `x = 0`

3. **Post-Loop Sampling:**
   - The loop terminates after the 5th iteration because `x` becomes `0`, and the condition `x > 0` is no longer true. At this point, `x = 0`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):**
The provided post-condition is `(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)`, which means "if `n` is non-negative, then `x` must be `0` after the loop."

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
No, the verification goal cannot directly serve as the loop invariant because it is only true at the termination of the loop, not during the iterations. During the loop, `x` is not `0` (except possibly at the end), so `x == 0` is not true in the middle of execution.

**Modifying the Verification Goal to Create an Invariant:**
We can modify the verification goal to create a loop invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `n` during the loop. A suitable invariant would be `x >= 0 && x <= n`. This is because:
- At the start of the loop, `x = n`, so `x >= 0 && x <= n` holds if `n >= 0`.
- During the loop, `x` is decremented by `1` each time, so it remains `>= 0` and `<= n` (since `x` starts at `n` and decreases).
- At termination, `x == 0` (if `n >= 0`), which satisfies the post-condition.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant (Natural Language):**
"At the start and end of every iteration, `x` is between `0` and the initial value `n` (inclusive), and `x` is decremented by `1` in each iteration."

**Formal Invariant:**
```c
/*@ loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= n;
*/
```

**Why This Invariant is Valid:**
- The invariant `x >= 0 && x <= n` is true at the start of the loop because `x` is initialized to `n`, and if `n >= 0`, then `x` is between `0` and `n`.
- During the loop, `x` is decremented by `1` each time, but since the loop only runs while `x > 0`, `x` will never go below `0` during the loop, and it will always be `<= n` because it starts at `n` and decreases.
- At termination, `x` is `0`, which satisfies `x >= 0 && x <= n`.

### e. Establishment

**How the Invariant is Established:**
Before the loop begins, `x` is initialized to `n`. Thus:
- If `n >= 0`, then `x = n >= 0` and `x = n <= n`, so `x >= 0 && x <= n` holds.
- If `n < 0`, the loop condition `x > 0` is false immediately, so the loop doesn't run, and the invariant is vacuously true (since the loop body is never executed).

Thus, the invariant is established before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, i.e., `x >= 0 && x <= n` and `x > 0` (since the loop condition is true). 
- The loop body executes `x = x - 1`. 
- Since `x > 0` at the start, `x - 1 >= 0` after the decrement.
- Since `x <= n` at the start and `x` is decremented, `x - 1 <= n` (because `x` was at most `n` and is now smaller).
Thus, after the iteration, `x >= 0 && x <= n` still holds.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State at Termination:**
The loop terminates when `x > 0` is false, i.e., `x <= 0`. From the invariant, we know `x >= 0`, so at termination, `x == 0`.

**Why the Invariant Remains Valid:**
At termination, `x == 0`, which satisfies `x >= 0 && x <= n` (since `n >= 0` is assumed in the post-condition). Thus, the invariant holds at termination.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Provided Post-condition:**
`(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)`

**Evaluation:**
The post-condition is correct. Here’s why:
- The loop invariant is `x >= 0 && x <= n`.
- At termination, the loop condition is false: `x <= 0`. Combined with the invariant `x >= 0`, we get `x == 0`.
- Thus, if `n >= 0`, the loop will run until `x == 0`, satisfying the post-condition. If `n < 0`, the loop doesn't run, and `x = n < 0`, so the post-condition is vacuously true (since the premise `n >= 0` is false).

**How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
- Invariant at termination: `x >= 0 && x <= n` and `x <= 0` (from loop exit), so `x == 0`.
- If `n >= 0`, the invariant ensures `x` reaches `0` (since `x` starts at `n` and counts down to `0`).
- Thus, the post-condition `(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)` is satisfied.

2025-12-27 10:05:58,626 - DEBUG  - invgen reasoning
2025-12-27 10:05:58,626 - DEBUG  - ### Analysis and Solution:

The loop decrements `x` from `n` down to `0`. The post-condition asserts that if `n >= 0`, then `x` must be `0` after the loop. To verify this, we need a loop invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `n` during the loop.

### Loop Invariant:
The invariant should state that `x` is always between `0` and `n` (inclusive) during the loop. This is because:
1. At the start, `x = n`, so `0 <= x <= n` holds if `n >= 0`.
2. In each iteration, `x` is decremented by `1`, but since the loop runs only while `x > 0`, `x` remains `>= 0`.
3. At termination, `x` is `0`, which satisfies the post-condition.

### Assigns Clause:
The loop only modifies `x`, so the `loop assigns` clause should specify `x`.

### Final Answer:
```c
void foo29(int n) {
    int x = n;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x > 0) {
        x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == 0); */
}
```

### Explanation of Annotations:
1. `loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;`: This ensures that `x` is always between `0` and `n` during the loop.
2. `loop assigns x;`: This specifies that the loop only modifies `x`.

These annotations allow Frama-C to verify that the post-condition `(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)` holds after the loop terminates.

2025-12-27 10:06:11,475 - DEBUG  - Here is the complete C code with the loop invariants filled in:

```c
void foo29(int n) {
    int x = n;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (x >= 0 && x <= \at(n,Pre));
      loop invariant (!(\at(n,Pre) > 0)) ==> ((x == \at(n,Pre))&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
      loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x > 0) {
        x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == 0); */
}
```

The key aspects of this solution:

1. For the case when `\at(n,Pre) > 0`, we maintain that `x` is between 0 and the initial value of `n` (inclusive)
2. For the case when `\at(n,Pre) <= 0`, we maintain that `x` and `n` remain equal to their initial values (the loop won't execute)
3. We always maintain that `n` equals its initial value
4. The loop only assigns to `x`

This satisfies all the requirements while:
- Not modifying existing annotations
- Not using `\at(var, LoopEntry)` except where already present
- Not adding any new annotations
- Using only ACSL-supported constructs
- Not including natural language explanations
- Properly handling all cases including when the loop condition is unknown
- Only filling the specified placeholders
- Using equality constraints comprehensively as requested

2025-12-27 10:06:33,273 - DEBUG  - Here's the complete C code with the loop invariants filled in, using the verification goal directly where possible:

```c
void foo29(int n) {
    int x = n;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> ((n >= 0) ==> (x >= 0));
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (x <= \at(n,Pre));
      loop invariant (!(\at(n,Pre) > 0)) ==> ((x == \at(n,Pre))&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
      loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x > 0) {
        x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == 0); */
}
```

Key points about this solution:

1. For `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`, I've used `(n >= 0) ==> (x >= 0)` which is a weaker form of the verification goal that holds throughout the loop

2. For `PLACE_HOLDER_x`, I've used `x <= \at(n,Pre)` to maintain the upper bound relationship

3. The other invariants remain unchanged:
   - For the case when initial n ≤ 0, we maintain the initial values
   - We preserve that n remains unchanged
   - We specify that only x is modified

4. The solution satisfies all requirements:
   - Doesn't modify existing annotations
   - Only fills placeholders
   - Uses only ACSL constructs
   - Maintains all necessary invariants
   - Handles all cases including unknown iterations
   - Uses equality constraints where appropriate

The verification goal `(n >= 0) ==> (x == 0)` cannot be used directly as an invariant since it's only true at termination, but we've used a weaker form that holds throughout the loop.
