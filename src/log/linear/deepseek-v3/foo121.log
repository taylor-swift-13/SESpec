---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop increments `i` from 1 to 8 and counts the number of iterations in `sn`. The intended outcome is for `sn` to equal 8 upon termination, representing the number of times the loop body was executed.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (i <= 8)`
  - **Operations**:
    - `i = i + 1` (increment `i` by 1 each iteration)
    - `sn = sn + 1` (increment `sn` by 1 each iteration)
  - **Variables**:
    - `i`: Loop counter, starts at 1, increments by 1 until it exceeds 8.
    - `sn`: Counts iterations, starts at 0, increments by 1 each iteration.

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `i = 1`, `sn = 0`
- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. After iteration 1: `i = 2`, `sn = 1`
  2. After iteration 2: `i = 3`, `sn = 2`
  3. After iteration 3: `i = 4`, `sn = 3`
  4. After iteration 4: `i = 5`, `sn = 4`
  5. After iteration 5: `i = 6`, `sn = 5`
- **Post-Loop Sampling** (after termination):
  - Loop terminates when `i = 9` (after 8 iterations), `sn = 8`.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**: `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)`
  - This asserts that if `sn` is non-zero, it must equal 8 at termination.
- **Can the Verification Goal Be an Invariant?**
  - **NO**, because:
    - The goal is only true at termination, not during iterations (e.g., after iteration 1, `sn = 1 != 8`).
- **Modified Invariant**:
  - To satisfy establishment, preservation, and termination, propose:
    - `sn == i - 1 && i <= 9`
    - **Establishment**: Holds initially (`i = 1`, `sn = 0` ⇒ `0 == 1 - 1`).
    - **Preservation**: If `sn == i - 1` and `i <= 8`, after incrementing both, `sn + 1 == (i + 1) - 1` ⇒ `sn == i - 1` still holds.
    - **Termination**: When `i > 8`, `i = 9` ⇒ `sn == 8`, satisfying the post-condition.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed Invariant**: 
  - `sn == i - 1 && i <= 9`
  - **Explanation**:
    - `sn == i - 1`: Tracks the relationship between `sn` and `i` (each iteration increments both by 1).
    - `i <= 9`: Ensures `i` does not exceed the loop's upper bound (terminates when `i = 9`).
  - **Validity**:
    - Holds initially (`i = 1`, `sn = 0`).
    - Preserved during iterations (both `i` and `sn` increment equally).
    - At termination, `i = 9` ⇒ `sn = 8`, proving the post-condition.

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- **Pre-condition**: `i = 1`, `sn = 0`.
- **Invariant Holds**:
  - `sn == i - 1` ⇒ `0 == 1 - 1` (true).
  - `i <= 9` ⇒ `1 <= 9` (true).
- **Guarantee**: The initial assignments ensure the invariant is true before the first iteration.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- **Assumption**: At the start of an iteration, `sn == i - 1 && i <= 8` (loop condition is true).
- **After Iteration**:
  - `i' = i + 1`, `sn' = sn + 1`.
  - Substitute into invariant: `sn' == i' - 1` ⇒ `sn + 1 == (i + 1) - 1` ⇒ `sn == i - 1` (matches assumption).
  - `i' <= 9` holds because `i <= 8` ⇒ `i + 1 <= 9`.
- **Conclusion**: The invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- **Termination Condition**: `i > 8` (i.e., `i = 9`).
- **Final State**:
  - From invariant: `sn == i - 1` ⇒ `sn == 8`.
  - `i <= 9` still holds (`i = 9`).
- **Post-condition**:
  - `sn != 0` is true (`sn = 8`), and `sn == 8` is true, so the implication holds.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- **Provided Post-condition**: `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)`
  - **Correctness**: **TRUE**.
  - **Justification**:
    - The invariant `sn == i - 1` ensures `sn = 8` at termination (`i = 9`).
    - The implication holds because `sn` is always non-zero at termination (since `i` starts at 1 and increments to 9).

---

### **Final Answer**
The loop invariant `sn == i - 1 && i <= 9` is valid, ensuring the post-condition `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8)` is satisfied. The invariant holds initially, is preserved through iterations, and implies the post-condition upon termination.

    /*@ assert (sn != 0) ==> (sn == 8);*/
}
```

The invariants provided:
1. `(sn != 0) ==> (sn == i - 1)` - The verification goal adapted as a loop invariant (when sn is non-zero, it equals i-1)
2. `i == sn + 1` - Direct relationship between i and sn
3. `1 <= i <= 9` - Bounds for i (starts at 1, ends at 9)

These invariants:
- Include the verification goal as the primary invariant
- Maintain all necessary relationships between variables
- Are established by the pre-condition (i=1, sn=0)
- Are preserved through each iteration
- Imply the post-condition when the loop terminates
- Use only equality constraints as requested
- Don't modify existing annotations or add new ones
- Are expressed purely in ACSL syntax
