---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop increments three variables (`i`, `j`, `k`) by `3` in each iteration until `i` reaches or exceeds `n`. The intended outcome is to ensure that `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented in lockstep, maintaining their equality throughout the loop.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (i < n)`.
  - **Loop Body**: 
    ```c
    i = i + 3;
    j = j + 3;
    k = k + 3;
    ```
  - **Relevant Variables**: 
    - `i`: Loop counter, incremented by `3` each iteration.
    - `j`, `k`: Additional variables also incremented by `3` each iteration, mirroring `i`.

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
Assume `n = 10` for illustration:

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
   - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.

2. **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
   - After iteration 1: `i = 3`, `j = 3`, `k = 3`.
   - After iteration 2: `i = 6`, `j = 6`, `k = 6`.
   - After iteration 3: `i = 9`, `j = 9`, `k = 9`.
   - After iteration 4: `i = 12`, `j = 12`, `k = 12` (loop terminates here since `i >= n`).

3. **Post-Loop Sampling**:
   - `i = 12`, `j = 12`, `k = 12`.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Provided Post-Condition**: 
  ```c
  (n > 0 && n <= 20000001) ==> (i % (20000003))
  ```
  - This is syntactically incorrect (missing operand after `%`). Assuming the intent was to check divisibility or a relationship with `20000003`, but it’s unclear. For now, we focus on the loop’s behavior.

- **Verification Goal as Invariant?**:
  - The post-condition is not usable as an invariant because:
    1. It references `20000003`, which is unrelated to the loop’s logic.
    2. It doesn’t describe a property maintained during iterations (e.g., `i == j == k`).

- **Proposed Invariant**:
  - `i == j && j == k && i % 3 == 0`.
  - **Justification**:
    - All variables start at `0` and are incremented by `3`, so they remain equal and divisible by `3`.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed Invariant**:
  ```c
  /*@ loop invariant i == j && j == k && i % 3 == 0; */
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - **Equality**: `i`, `j`, `k` are always equal because they are incremented identically.
  - **Divisibility**: `i` starts at `0` (divisible by `3`) and increments by `3`, preserving divisibility.

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- **Pre-Loop State**: 
  - `i = j = k = 0`.
  - `0 == 0 && 0 % 3 == 0` holds trivially.
- **Pre-Condition Guarantee**: 
  - The pre-condition `n > 0` ensures the loop may execute, but the invariant is established regardless of `n`.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- **Assumption**: At the start of an iteration, `i == j == k` and `i % 3 == 0`.
- **After Iteration**:
  - `i = i + 3`, `j = j + 3`, `k = k + 3`.
  - Since `i`, `j`, `k` were equal, they remain equal after incrementing by `3`.
  - If `i % 3 == 0` before, then `(i + 3) % 3 == 0` after.
- **Conclusion**: The invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- **Termination Condition**: `i >= n`.
- **Termination State**:
  - `i = j = k = 3 * ceil(n / 3)` (next multiple of `3` ≥ `n`).
  - Example: For `n = 10`, `i = 12`.
- **Invariant Validity**: 
  - The invariant `i == j == k && i % 3 == 0` still holds at termination.

---

#### **h. Post-Condition Correctness**
- **Provided Post-Condition**: Incorrect/unclear (as written).
- **Correct Post-Condition**:
  - If the intent was to ensure `i` is a multiple of `3`:
    ```c
    /*@ ensures i % 3 == 0 && j % 3 == 0 && k % 3 == 0; */
    ```
  - **Proof**:
    - The invariant `i % 3 == 0` holds at termination.
    - Combined with termination (`i >= n`), the post-condition follows.

---

### **Final Answer**
1. **Loop Invariant**:
   ```c
   /*@ loop invariant i == j && j == k && i % 3 == 0; */
   ```
2. **Correct Post-Condition**:
   ```c
   /*@ ensures i % 3 == 0 && j % 3 == 0 && k % 3 == 0; */
   ```
3. **Conclusion**: The loop correctly maintains the invariant, and the post-condition can be derived from it. The original post-condition is invalid and should be replaced.

The loop invariants are:
1. `i == j && j == k` - All three variables remain equal throughout the loop
2. `i % 3 == 0` - i is always a multiple of 3 (and by extension, so are j and k)
3. `loop assigns i, j, k` - These are the only variables modified by the loop

The invariants hold because:
- Initially, i = j = k = 0 (establishment)
- Each iteration adds 3 to all variables equally (preservation)
- The invariants remain true when the loop terminates

2025-12-27 19:34:38,997 - DEBUG  - Based on the strict rules provided, here's the completed C code with comprehensive loop invariants:

```c
/*@
    requires n > 0 && n <= 20000001;
*/
void foo316(unsigned int n) {
    unsigned int j;
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int k;

    i = 0;
    k = 0;
    j = 0;

    /*@
        loop invariant i == j && j == k;
        loop invariant i % 3 == 0;
        loop invariant j % 3 == 0;
        loop invariant k % 3 == 0;
        loop invariant i <= n + 2;
        loop assigns i, j, k;
    */
    while (i < n) {
        i = i + 3;
        j = j + 3;
        k = k + 3;
    }

    /*@ assert (n > 0 && n <= 20000001) ==> (i % (20000003)); */
}
```

The invariants include:
1. Equality constraints showing all three variables remain synchronized
2. Divisibility by 3 constraints for each variable
3. An upper bound constraint showing i won't exceed n by more than 2
4. The loop assigns clause specifying which variables are modified

All invariants:
- Hold initially (i=j=k=0)
- Are preserved by each iteration (+3 to each)
- Imply the post-condition when combined with loop termination
- Are expressed purely in ACSL without natural language
- Don't use \at or modify existing annotations
- Don't include variants or extra requires/ensures

        loop invariant (!(i < n)) ==> (i % 20000003 == 0 && j % 20000003 == 0 && k % 20000003 == 0);
        loop assigns i, j, k;
    */
    while (i < n) {
        i = i + 3;
        j = j + 3;
        k = k + 3;
    }

    /*@ assert (n > 0 && n <= 20000001) ==> (i % (20000003)); */
}
```

The verification goal `i % 20000003` is used directly as part of the loop invariant since:
1. It holds initially (0 % 20000003 == 0)
2. It's preserved by each iteration (adding 3 maintains divisibility by 20000003)
3. It implies the post-condition when the loop terminates

The invariant is structured to hold:
- During execution (`i < n` case)
- At termination (`!(i < n)` case)
- For all three variables (i, j, k) since they maintain identical values

The `loop assigns` clause correctly specifies all modified variables.
