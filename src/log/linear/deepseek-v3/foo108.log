2025-12-27 14:11:47,513 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### **Loop Verification Analysis for `foo108`**

---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop iterates `c` times, adjusting the value of `m` to ensure it is not less than `a`. The loop's primary effect is to enforce the condition `a <= m` by setting `m = a` if `m < a` at any point during the iterations.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (k < c)`  
    The loop runs as long as the counter `k` is less than `c`.
  - **Operations in the Body**:
    1. **Conditional Check**: `if (m < a) { m = a; }`  
       If `m` is smaller than `a`, `m` is set to `a`.
    2. **Increment Counter**: `k = k + 1`  
       The loop counter `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
  - **Relevant Variables**:
    - `m`: The value being adjusted (must satisfy `a <= m` at termination).
    - `a`: The lower bound for `m`.
    - `k`: Loop counter (starts at `0`, increments by `1` each iteration).
    - `c`: Total number of iterations (loop bound).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
Assume initial values:  
- Pre-loop: `m = m0`, `a = a0`, `k = 0`, `c = 5` (for sampling).  
- Precondition: `a0 <= m0` (given by `requires`).

| Iteration | Pre-loop/Post-iteration | `m`       | `a`  | `k` | `c` | Notes                                  |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|------|-----|-----|---------------------------------------|
| 0         | Pre-loop                | `m0`      | `a0` | `0` | `5` | `a0 <= m0` (precondition holds).      |
| 1         | Post-iteration 1        | `max(m0, a0)` | `a0` | `1` | `5` | If `m0 < a0`, `m` is set to `a0`.     |
| 2         | Post-iteration 2        | `max(m0, a0)` | `a0` | `2` | `5` | No further changes to `m`.             |
| 3         | Post-iteration 3        | `max(m0, a0)` | `a0` | `3` | `5` | `m` remains `>= a0`.                  |
| 4         | Post-iteration 4        | `max(m0, a0)` | `a0` | `4` | `5` | Still `a0 <= m`.                      |
| 5         | Post-iteration 5        | `max(m0, a0)` | `a0` | `5` | `5` | Loop terminates (`k == c`).           |

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Post-condition**: `a <= m` (given by `assert`).
- **Can the post-condition be an invariant?**  
  **Yes**, because:
  1. **Establishment**: The precondition `a <= m` ensures it holds before the loop.
  2. **Preservation**: The loop body ensures `m` is never set below `a`.
  3. **Termination**: At termination, the invariant still holds, implying the post-condition.

No modification is needed; the post-condition itself is a valid invariant.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed Invariant**: `a <= m`  
  This is already the post-condition, and it holds:
  - **Before the loop**: Guaranteed by the precondition.
  - **During the loop**: The body only increases `m` (to `a` if `m < a`), so `a <= m` remains true.
  - **After the loop**: The invariant still holds, ensuring the post-condition.

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- The invariant `a <= m` holds before the loop because:
  - The function's `requires` clause ensures `a <= m` at entry.
  - No operations modify `m` or `a` before the loop starts.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- At the start of an iteration, assume `a <= m` holds.
- The loop body:
  1. Checks `if (m < a)`: If true, sets `m = a`, so `a <= m` becomes true.
  2. If `m >= a` initially, `m` is unchanged, so `a <= m` remains true.
- Thus, the invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- The loop terminates when `k >= c`.
- At termination:
  - The invariant `a <= m` still holds (as shown in preservation).
  - The post-condition `a <= m` is implied directly by the invariant.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- The post-condition `a <= m` is **correct** because:
  1. The invariant `a <= m` holds at termination.
  2. The loop condition is false (`k >= c`), but this does not affect `m` or `a`.
  3. Thus, the invariant implies the post-condition.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**
The loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant a <= m; */
```
This holds because:
1. It is initially true (due to the precondition).
2. The loop body ensures `m` never becomes smaller than `a`.
3. At termination, it implies the post-condition `a <= m`.

```c
/*@
    requires a <= m;
    */
    
/*@ requires a <= m;*/
void foo108(int m,int j,int a,int c) {

    int k = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant a <= m;
      loop invariant 0 <= k <= c;
      loop invariant k == \at(k, Pre) + \numof(m, a, k);
      loop assigns k, m;
    */
    while (k < c) {
        if(m < a) {
            m = a;
        }
        k = k + 1;
    }
            
    /*@ assert a <= m; */
}
```

The invariants include:
1. `a <= m` - The main property we want to maintain
2. `0 <= k <= c` - Bounds on the loop counter
3. `k == \at(k, Pre) + \numof(m, a, k)` - Relates initial and current values
4. `loop assigns` specifies exactly which variables are modified

All placeholders have been replaced while following all the specified rules. No additional annotations were added beyond the required invariants.

2025-12-27 14:12:15,255 - DEBUG  - Here is the complete C code with the loop invariants filled in according to the specified rules:

```c
/*@
    requires a <= m;
    */
    
/*@ requires a <= m;*/
void foo108(int m,int j,int a,int c) {

    int k = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant (k < c) ==> (a <= m);
      loop invariant (!(k < c)) ==> (a <= m);
      loop assigns k, m;
    */
    while (k < c) {
        if(m < a) {
            m = a;
        }
        k = k + 1;
    }
            
    /*@ assert a <= m; */
}
```

Key points about the solution:
1. The verification goal `a <= m` is used directly as the loop invariant in both cases
2. The invariant holds:
   - During loop execution `(k < c) ==> (a <= m)`
   - After loop termination `(!(k < c)) ==> (a <= m)`
3. The `loop assigns` clause correctly specifies that only `k` and `m` are modified
4. No additional annotations were added beyond replacing the placeholders
5. All rules were strictly followed, including:
   - Not using `\at(var, LoopEntry)`
   - Not adding any new annotations
   - Not including loop variants
   - Only using ACSL-supported constructs
