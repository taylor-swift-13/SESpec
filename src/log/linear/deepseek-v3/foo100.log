2025-12-27 13:28:47,734 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop in the function `foo100` is designed to count down from a given non-negative integer `n` (stored in `x`) while simultaneously counting up from 0 (stored in `y`). The intended outcome is that after the loop terminates, `y` will be equal to the original value of `n`.

**Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x > 0)`
- **Loop Body Operations:**
  - `y = y + 1` (increment `y` by 1)
  - `x = x - 1` (decrement `x` by 1)
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `n`: The input parameter, required to be non-negative (`n >= 0`).
  - `x`: Initially set to `n`, decremented by 1 in each iteration.
  - `y`: Initially set to 0, incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

Assume `n = 5` for the sampling:

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
   - `x = 5`, `y = 0`

2. **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
   - After iteration 1: `x = 4`, `y = 1`
   - After iteration 2: `x = 3`, `y = 2`
   - After iteration 3: `x = 2`, `y = 3`
   - After iteration 4: `x = 1`, `y = 4`
   - After iteration 5: `x = 0`, `y = 5`

3. **Post-Loop Sampling:**
   - Loop terminates after iteration 5 (since `x = 0` and `x > 0` is false).
   - Final values: `x = 0`, `y = 5`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-condition):** `y == n`

**Can the verification goal be used as an invariant?**
- No, because `y == n` is only true at the end of the loop (when `x = 0`). During the loop, `y` is always less than `n` (since `x` is positive and `x + y = n`).

**Modified Invariant:**
- The invariant should capture the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `n` that holds throughout the loop. A suitable invariant is `x + y == n`.
  - **Establishment:** Before the loop, `x = n` and `y = 0`, so `x + y = n + 0 = n`.
  - **Preservation:** In each iteration, `y` increases by 1 and `x` decreases by 1, so `x + y` remains unchanged (`(x - 1) + (y + 1) = x + y`).
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates (`x == 0`), the invariant `x + y == n` becomes `0 + y == n`, which implies `y == n` (the post-condition).

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:** `x + y == n`

**Explanation:**
- The invariant `x + y == n` holds true at the start of the loop (as shown in Establishment).
- In each iteration, `x` is decremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1, so their sum remains constant (`n`).
- Thus, the invariant is preserved through each iteration.
- At termination, the invariant implies the post-condition `y == n`.

### e. Establishment

**How the invariant is established:**
- Before the loop, `x` is initialized to `n` and `y` is initialized to `0`.
- Thus, `x + y = n + 0 = n`, so the invariant `x + y == n` holds before the first iteration.
- The pre-condition `n >= 0` ensures that `x` and `y` are initialized correctly and the loop can start (if `n > 0`).

### f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved:**
- At the start of an iteration, assume `x + y == n` and `x > 0`.
- The loop body executes `y = y + 1` and `x = x - 1`.
- The new values are `x' = x - 1` and `y' = y + 1`.
- Thus, `x' + y' = (x - 1) + (y + 1) = x + y = n`.
- Therefore, the invariant `x + y == n` holds at the end of the iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State at Termination:**
- The loop terminates when `x <= 0` (specifically, `x == 0` because `x` is decremented by 1 each time from a positive value).
- At termination, the invariant `x + y == n` holds, and `x == 0`.
- Thus, `0 + y == n` implies `y == n`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
- The post-condition is `y == n`.
- At termination, the invariant `x + y == n` holds and `x == 0`, so `y == n`.
- Therefore, the post-condition is correct and is implied by the invariant and the negation of the loop condition (`x <= 0`).

### Final Answer: Loop Invariant

The correct loop invariant for this code is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant x + y == n; */
```

This invariant satisfies all the necessary conditions (establishment, preservation, and termination) and ensures the post-condition `y == n` holds upon loop termination.

void foo100(int n) {
    int x = n;
    int y = 0;

        loop invariant x + y == n;

```

The loop invariant `x + y == n` satisfies all the necessary conditions:
1. It holds initially (when `x = n` and `y = 0`)
2. It is preserved by each iteration (since both `x` decreases by 1 and `y` increases by 1)
3. At termination (when `x == 0`), it implies the post-condition `y == n`

The `loop assigns` annotation specifies that only `x` and `y` are modified by the loop.

2025-12-27 13:29:07,213 - DEBUG  - Here is the completed C code with comprehensive loop invariants in ACSL annotations:

```c
/*@
    requires n>=0;
*/
void foo100(int n) {
    int x = n;
    int y = 0;
    
    /*@
        loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (x + y == \at(n,Pre));
        loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 0) ==> (x >= 0 && y >= 0);
        loop invariant (!(\at(n,Pre) > 0)) ==> ((y == 0)&&(x == \at(n,Pre))&&(n == \at(n,Pre)));
        loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
        loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while (x > 0) {
        y = y + 1;
        x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert y == n; */
}
```

The invariants satisfy all requirements:
1. For positive n: maintains the key relationship `x + y == \at(n,Pre)` and non-negativity
2. For non-positive n: preserves initial conditions
3. Always maintains `n == \at(n,Pre)`
4. Specifies exactly which variables are modified (`loop assigns`)

The invariants are strong enough to prove the post-condition `y == n` while being weak enough to be preserved by each iteration. The case analysis (`n > 0` vs `n <= 0`) ensures correctness for all possible inputs.

        y = y + 1;
        x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert y == n; */
}
```

Key points about the invariants:

1. The verification goal `y == n` cannot be used directly as an invariant since it's only true at termination. Instead, we use the stronger invariant `y == \at(n,Pre) - x` which:
   - Holds initially (when x=n and y=0)
   - Is preserved by each iteration
   - Implies the post-condition when x=0

2. Additional invariants ensure:
   - x remains non-negative
   - y never exceeds the initial n
   - Initial conditions are preserved when n ≤ 0
   - n remains unchanged

3. The `loop assigns` clause properly specifies which variables are modified.

This set of invariants is sufficient to prove the post-condition while being weak enough to be preserved by the loop body.
