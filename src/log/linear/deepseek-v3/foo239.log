---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop increments three variables (`i`, `j`, `k`) in each iteration, with `i` increasing by 1, `j` by 2, and `k` by 3. The loop terminates when `k` reaches or exceeds `268435455`. The post-condition asserts that `j == 2 * i` after the loop.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing condition**: `while (k < 268435455)`
  - **Body operations**:
    - `i = i + 1`
    - `j = j + 2`
    - `k = k + 3`
  - **Relevant variables**: `i`, `j`, `k` (all initialized to `0`).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.
- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. After 1st iteration: `i = 1`, `j = 2`, `k = 3`.
  2. After 2nd iteration: `i = 2`, `j = 4`, `k = 6`.
  3. After 3rd iteration: `i = 3`, `j = 6`, `k = 9`.
  4. After 4th iteration: `i = 4`, `j = 8`, `k = 12`.
  5. After 5th iteration: `i = 5`, `j = 10`, `k = 15`.
- **Post-Loop Sampling**: Not applicable here (loop runs for many more iterations before termination).

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Verification Goal**: `j == 2 * i` (post-condition).
- **Can it be an invariant?**  
  **YES**, because:
  - The relationship `j == 2 * i` holds **at every iteration** (see sampled values). It is preserved because `j` increases by 2 for every 1 increase in `i`.
- **No modification needed**: The post-condition is already a valid invariant.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed Invariant**:  
  `j == 2 * i && k == 3 * i`.  
  - **Explanation**: 
    - `j == 2 * i` is the post-condition and holds at every iteration.
    - `k == 3 * i` is derived from the observation that `k` increases by 3 for every 1 increase in `i`. This relationship is also preserved throughout the loop.

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- **Pre-loop state**: `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.
- **Invariant holds initially**:  
  `j == 2 * i` → `0 == 2 * 0` (true).  
  `k == 3 * i` → `0 == 3 * 0` (true).

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- **At start of iteration**: Assume `j == 2 * i` and `k == 3 * i`.
- **After iteration**:
  - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
  - `j` becomes `j + 2` = `2 * i + 2` = `2 * (i + 1)`.
  - `k` becomes `k + 3` = `3 * i + 3` = `3 * (i + 1)`.
- **Invariant still holds**:  
  `j == 2 * i` and `k == 3 * i` are preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- **Termination condition**: `k >= 268435455`.
- **Final state**:  
  Let `n` be the number of iterations. Then:
  - `i = n`, `j = 2n`, `k = 3n`.
  - Loop stops when `3n >= 268435455` → `n >= 89478485`.
- **Invariant at termination**:  
  `j == 2 * i` and `k == 3 * i` still hold.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- **Post-condition**: `j == 2 * i`.
- **Proof**:  
  - The invariant `j == 2 * i` holds at termination.
  - The loop condition `k < 268435455` is false, but this does not affect the invariant.
  - Thus, the post-condition is **correct** and follows directly from the invariant.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**
The loop invariant is:
```c
/*@
  loop invariant j == 2 * i;
  loop invariant k == 3 * i;
*/
```
This ensures that `j` is always twice `i` and `k` is always thrice `i` at every iteration, including termination. The post-condition `j == 2 * i` is thus satisfied.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.

1. Maintained the exact relationship between i, j, and k (j=2i and k=3i)
2. Added an invariant showing how i relates to the initial and current k values
3. Included all modified variables in loop assigns
4. Kept all existing annotations unchanged
5. Avoided using \at(var, LoopEntry) by using \at(k, Pre) to reference the pre-loop value
6. Did not add any new annotations beyond filling the placeholders
7. The invariants will hold for any number of iterations

The invariants are strong enough to prove the post-condition while being as precise as possible about the relationships between variables throughout the loop's execution.

```

Key points about this solution:
1. Used the verification goal `j == 2 * i` directly as the first invariant (as requested)
2. Added comprehensive equality constraints showing all relationships between variables:
   - `k == 3 * i` (since k increments by 3 when i increments by 1)
   - `i == k / 3` (alternative expression of the same relationship)
   - `j == (2 * k) / 3` (showing j's relationship to k)
3. Included all modified variables in `loop assigns`
4. Maintained all original annotations without modification
5. All invariants hold for any number of iterations
6. The verification goal is provable from these invariants at loop exit
