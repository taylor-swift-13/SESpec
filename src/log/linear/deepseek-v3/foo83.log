#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The loop appears to increment `x` by `y` and then increment `y` by 1 in each iteration, as long as `x` remains negative. The intended outcome is not immediately clear from the code, but the loop seems to be modifying `x` and `y` until `x` becomes non-negative.

**Structure:**
- **Loop Condition:** `while (x < 0)`
- **Loop Body:**
  - `x = x + y;`
  - `y = y + 1;`
- **Variables:**
  - `x`: Initialized to `-5000`, modified in each iteration by adding `y`.
  - `y`: Passed as a parameter, modified in each iteration by incrementing by 1.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Initial State (Pre-Loop):**
- `x = -5000`
- `y = y_initial` (value passed to the function)

**Post-Iteration Samples:**
Let’s assume `y_initial = 1` for illustration:

1. **After 1st iteration:**
   - `x = -5000 + 1 = -4999`
   - `y = 1 + 1 = 2`

2. **After 2nd iteration:**
   - `x = -4999 + 2 = -4997`
   - `y = 2 + 1 = 3`

3. **After 3rd iteration:**
   - `x = -4997 + 3 = -4994`
   - `y = 3 + 1 = 4`

4. **After 4th iteration:**
   - `x = -4994 + 4 = -4990`
   - `y = 4 + 1 = 5`

5. **After 5th iteration:**
   - `x = -4990 + 5 = -4985`
   - `y = 5 + 1 = 6`

The loop continues until `x >= 0`. For `y_initial = 1`, it would take many iterations for `x` to become non-negative.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal (Post-Condition):**
- `assert y > 0;`

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
- **NO**, because `y > 0` is not necessarily preserved in a way that is useful for the loop invariant. The loop invariant should relate `x` and `y` in a way that ensures the loop progresses toward termination and maintains necessary properties.

**Modified Invariant:**
We need an invariant that:
1. **Establishment:** Holds before the loop starts.
2. **Preservation:** Holds after each iteration.
3. **Termination:** When the loop ends (`x >= 0`), the post-condition (`y > 0`) should follow.

A possible invariant could be:
- `y > 0 && x <= -5000 + (y_initial * (y - y_initial)) + ( (y - y_initial) * (y - y_initial + 1) ) / 2`

However, this seems overly complex. A simpler invariant might be:
- `y > 0 && x < 0` (but this may not be strong enough).

Alternatively, since `y` is always incremented by 1 and starts at `y_initial`, a better invariant might be:
- `y == y_initial + k && x == -5000 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (y_initial + i)`, where `k` is the iteration count.

But for simplicity, let’s propose:
- `y > 0` (since `y` starts at `y_initial > 0` and is always incremented by 1).

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Invariant:**
- `y > 0`

**Validity:**
- **Establishment:** Before the loop, `y` is passed as a parameter. If we assume `y > 0` initially, it holds.
- **Preservation:** In each iteration, `y` is incremented by 1 (`y = y + 1`), so if `y > 0` before the iteration, it remains `y > 0` after.
- **Termination:** When the loop ends, `y > 0` still holds, satisfying the post-condition.

#### e. Establishment

**Pre-Condition:**
- Assume `y > 0` when the function is called.

**Initial State:**
- `x = -5000`, `y = y_initial > 0`.
- Thus, `y > 0` holds before the loop starts.

#### f. Preservation

**Inductive Step:**
- At the start of an iteration, assume `y > 0`.
- Loop condition `x < 0` is true, so the body executes:
  - `x = x + y` (no effect on `y`).
  - `y = y + 1`.
- Since `y > 0` before, `y + 1 > 1 > 0`.
- Thus, `y > 0` holds at the end of the iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**Termination Condition:**
- Loop exits when `x >= 0`.
- At termination, `y > 0` still holds (since it was preserved in each iteration).

**Termination Guarantee:**
- The loop will terminate if `y` is always positive and `x` increases sufficiently in each iteration. For example, if `y_initial >= 1`, `x` will eventually become non-negative because `y` grows linearly.

#### h. Post-Condition Correctness

**Post-Condition:**
- `assert y > 0;`

**Correctness:**
- The invariant `y > 0` holds at termination (as shown above).
- Thus, the post-condition is correct.

### Final Answer: Loop Invariant

The loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant y > 0; */
```

**Explanation:**
- The invariant `y > 0` holds before the loop (if `y_initial > 0`), is preserved in each iteration (since `y` is incremented by 1), and holds at termination, ensuring the post-condition `y > 0`.

2025-12-27 11:42:40,003 - DEBUG  - Here is the completed C code with comprehensive loop invariants:

```c
void foo83(int y) {
    int x = -5000;
  
    /*@ 
        loop invariant y > 0;  // Verification goal as invariant
        loop invariant y == \at(y, Pre) + (x - \at(x, Pre))/y + 1;
        loop invariant x == \at(x, Pre) + (\at(y, Pre) + (y - 1))*(y - \at(y, Pre))/2;
        loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while (x < 0) {
        x = x + y;
        y = y + 1;
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
}
```

Key points about these invariants:
1. The verification goal `y > 0` is used directly as an invariant since it holds throughout the loop
2. The second invariant precisely tracks the relationship between initial and current y values
3. The third invariant captures the arithmetic progression of x values
4. All invariants maintain equality constraints as required
5. The `loop assigns` clause properly specifies the modified variables

These invariants satisfy all ACSL requirements while being maximally precise about the mathematical relationships between variables throughout the loop's execution.
