---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop decrements both `x` and `y` by `1` in each iteration until `x` reaches `0`. The intended outcome is that when the loop terminates, `y` should also be `0` (as asserted in the post-condition).
  
- **Structure**:
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (x != 0)`
  - **Loop Body**: 
    ```c
    x = x - 1;
    y = y - 1;
    ```
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` (loop counter), `y` (tracked alongside `x`).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

Assume `y = 5` (as per the pre-condition `y >= 0`). Since `x = y`, `x` is initially `5`.

| Iteration | Pre-Loop/Post-Iteration | `x` | `y` |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----|-----|
| -         | Pre-Loop                | 5   | 5   |
| 1         | Post-Iteration          | 4   | 4   |
| 2         | Post-Iteration          | 3   | 3   |
| 3         | Post-Iteration          | 2   | 2   |
| 4         | Post-Iteration          | 1   | 1   |
| 5         | Post-Iteration          | 0   | 0   |
| -         | Post-Loop               | 0   | 0   |

- The loop terminates after the 5th iteration when `x = 0`. At termination, `y = 0`.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**: `y == 0` (asserted at the end).
  
- **Can the Verification Goal Be an Invariant?**
  - **NO**, because `y == 0` is only true at termination, not during iterations. During execution, `y` changes.
  
- **Modified Invariant Proposal**:
  - The relationship between `x` and `y` is preserved: `y == x`.
  - **Establishment**: Before the loop, `x = y` (direct assignment), so `y == x` holds.
  - **Preservation**: In each iteration, both `x` and `y` are decremented by `1`, so `y == x` remains true.
  - **Termination**: When the loop exits (`x = 0`), the invariant `y == x` implies `y == 0`.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed Invariant**: `y == x`.
  
- **Explanation**:
  - The invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop.
  - It holds before the loop (due to `x = y`), is preserved in each iteration (both decremented equally), and implies the post-condition at termination.

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- **Pre-condition**: `y >= 0` and `x = y`.
- **Invariant Holds Initially**: Since `x = y`, the invariant `y == x` is trivially true before the loop starts.

---

#### **f. Preservation**

- **Assumption**: At the start of an iteration, `y == x` (invariant holds) and `x != 0` (loop condition).
- **After Iteration**:
  - `x` becomes `x - 1`, `y` becomes `y - 1`.
  - Since `y == x` before, `y - 1 == x - 1` after, so the invariant holds.
- **Conclusion**: The invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- **Termination Condition**: `x == 0`.
- **State at Termination**:
  - From the invariant `y == x`, when `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
- **Loop Invariant Holds**: The invariant `y == x` remains true, and the post-condition `y == 0` is satisfied.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**

- **Post-condition**: `y == 0` is correct.
- **Proof**:
  - The invariant `y == x` holds at termination (`x = 0`), so `y = 0`.
  - The negation of the loop condition (`x == 0`) combined with the invariant implies the post-condition.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**

The correct loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant y == x; */
```

This invariant:
1. Holds initially (`x = y`).
2. Is preserved in each iteration (both `x` and `y` decrement equally).
3. Implies the post-condition `y == 0` at termination (`x = 0`). 

Thus, the post-condition is formally verified.

The loop invariant `y == x` satisfies all requirements:
1. It holds initially since `x = y` is assigned before the loop
2. It is preserved in each iteration since both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1

4. The `loop assigns` clause properly specifies that only `x` and `y` are modified by the loop

The invariant is simple but sufficient to prove the post-condition without needing additional annotations or variants.

    while (x != 0) {
       x = x - 1;
       y = y - 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert y == 0; */
}
```

The invariants cover all cases:
1. When initial y != 0:
   - Maintains y == x relationship
   - Ensures both variables stay non-negative
2. When initial y == 0:
   - Preserves initial values (loop won't execute)
3. The assigns clause properly tracks modified variables

The invariants are comprehensive enough to prove the post-condition while following all the given constraints. The equality constraints fully capture the relationship between x and y throughout execution.

2025-12-27 19:03:27,256 - DEBUG  - Here is the completed C code with comprehensive loop invariants, using the verification goal directly where possible:

```c
/*@
    requires y >= 0;
    */
    
void foo270(int y) {
    int x;
    x = y;

    /*@
    loop invariant (\at(y,Pre) != 0) ==> (y == 0 || x != 0);
    loop invariant (\at(y,Pre) != 0) ==> (y == \at(y,Pre) - (\at(y,Pre) - x));
    loop invariant (\at(y,Pre) != 0) ==> (x == \at(y,Pre) - (\at(y,Pre) - x));
    loop invariant (!(\at(y,Pre) != 0)) ==> ((x == \at(y,Pre))&&(y == \at(y,Pre)));
    loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while (x != 0) {
       x = x - 1;
       y = y - 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert y == 0; */
}
```

Key points about the invariants:
1. The verification goal `y == 0` appears in the first invariant (`y == 0 || x != 0`) which holds throughout the loop
2. The relationships between x, y and their initial values are precisely maintained
3. The case where initial y is 0 is properly handled
4. All variable modifications are accounted for in the assigns clause
5. The invariants are strong enough to prove the post-condition while following all constraints

The invariants maintain the key properties:
- The countdown relationship between x and y
- The eventual termination condition
- The preservation of values when the loop doesn't execute
- The connection to the verification goal
