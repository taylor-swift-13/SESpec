---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop appears to be a non-deterministic counter manipulation loop. It modifies the variable `c` based on two nested `unknown()` conditions:
  1. If `unknown()` is true, it checks whether `c > n`. If so, it increments `c`.
  2. If `unknown()` is false, it checks whether `c == n`. If so, it resets `c` to `1`.

- **Intended Outcome**: The loop ensures that `c` is either:
  - Incremented (if `c > n`),
  - Reset to `1` (if `c == n`),
  - Or left unchanged (if neither condition is met).

- **Structure**:
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (unknown())` (non-deterministic).
  - **Loop Body**:
    - Nested `if (unknown())`:
      - If true: Checks `c > n` and increments `c` if true.
      - If false: Checks `c == n` and sets `c = 1` if true.
  - **Relevant Variables**:
    - `n` (input parameter, required to be `n > 0`).
    - `c` (counter, initialized to `0`).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

| Iteration | `unknown()` (outer) | `unknown()` (inner) | `c` (before body) | `c` (after body) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Pre-Loop  | -                   | -                   | `0`               | -                | Initial state. |
| 1         | True                | True                | `0`               | `0`              | `c > n` is false (`0 > n` is false). No change. |
| 2         | True                | False               | `0`               | `0`              | `c == n` is false (`0 == n` is false). No change. |
| 3         | True                | True                | `0`               | `0`              | Same as iteration 1. |
| 4         | True                | False               | `0`               | `1`              | Suppose `n = 1`, so `c == n` (`0 == 1`) is false. No change. (If `n = 0`, this violates the precondition.) |
| 5         | True                | True                | `1`               | `2`              | Suppose `n = 1`, `c > n` (`1 > 1`) is false. No change. |
| Post-Loop | False               | -                   | `2`               | `2`              | Loop terminates. |

*(Note: Since `unknown()` is non-deterministic, the samples are hypothetical.)*

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Post-condition**: `(c != n) ==> (c >= 0)`
  - Meaning: If `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` must be non-negative.

- **Can the post-condition be part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**, because:
    - The post-condition is only required to hold at termination, not necessarily during execution.
    - During execution, `c` could be negative if `n` were negative (but the precondition `n > 0` prevents this).

- **Modified Invariant**:
  - Since `n > 0` and `c` starts at `0` and is either incremented or set to `1`, we can strengthen the invariant to:
    - `c >= 0` (always true given the operations on `c`).
    - Additionally, `c <= n + 1` (since `c` is only incremented if `c > n`, which limits its growth).

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed Invariant**:
  - `c >= 0 && (c <= n + 1)`
    - `c` is always non-negative.
    - `c` never exceeds `n + 1` (since `c` is only incremented if `c > n`, which is impossible unless `c` was already `n + 1`).

- **Why is this valid?**
  - **Initialization**: `c = 0`, so `0 >= 0 && 0 <= n + 1` holds (since `n > 0`).
  - **Preservation**:
    - If `c > n` and `c = c + 1`, then `c` was `n + 1` before incrementing (but this violates `c <= n + 1`). Thus, `c` cannot grow beyond `n + 1`.
    - If `c == n` and `c = 1`, then `1 >= 0 && 1 <= n + 1` holds (since `n > 0`).
  - **Termination**: The invariant still holds when the loop exits.

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- Before the loop:
  - `c = 0`.
  - Precondition: `n > 0`.
  - Thus, `0 >= 0 && 0 <= n + 1` holds.

---

#### **f. Preservation**

Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (`c >= 0 && c <= n + 1`).

1. If `unknown()` is true:
   - If `c > n`:
     - Then `c = n + 1` (since `c <= n + 1` by invariant).
     - Incrementing gives `c = n + 2`, which violates `c <= n + 1`. Thus, this case cannot happen.
   - Else: `c` is unchanged.
2. If `unknown()` is false:
   - If `c == n`:
     - `c` is set to `1`, and `1 >= 0 && 1 <= n + 1` holds.
   - Else: `c` is unchanged.

Thus, the invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- When the loop terminates (`unknown()` is false):
  - The invariant `c >= 0 && c <= n + 1` still holds.
  - The post-condition `(c != n) ==> (c >= 0)` is implied because `c >= 0` is already part of the invariant.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**

- The post-condition is **correct**:
  - The invariant ensures `c >= 0`.
  - At termination, if `c != n`, then `c >= 0` is already true.
  - The invariant and loop operations ensure `c` is never negative.

---

### **Final Loop Invariant (ACSL Annotation)**

```c
/*@
  loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n + 1;
*/
while (unknown()) {
  ...
}
```

This invariant ensures the post-condition holds and is inductively maintained.

2025-12-27 11:30:10,045 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (c == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(n,Pre) > 0 && (c == 0) * (n == \at(n,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@

The loop invariant has been constructed to:
1. Maintain the initial condition (c == 0 && n unchanged) OR
2. Track all possible values of c during execution (1 ≤ c ≤ n+1) while preserving n's value
3. Explicitly state that n remains unchanged throughout the loop
4. Specify that only c is modified by the loop

The invariant covers all possible execution paths while being strong enough to prove the post-condition. The second disjunct (1 ≤ c ≤ n+1) captures all possible states c can take after the first iteration, while still maintaining the relationship with n.

The verification goal `(c != n) ==> (c >= 0)` is used directly as the first loop invariant since it holds throughout the loop execution. The other invariants:
1. Track the initial state or valid c values (1 ≤ c ≤ n+1)
2. Maintain n's constant value
3. Specify that only c is modified

This combination of invariants is sufficient to prove the post-condition while being inductive. The verification goal works as an invariant because:
- Initially c=0, so `(0 != n) ==> (0 >= 0)` holds
- All modifications either keep c non-negative or reset it to 1
- The condition is preserved through all possible execution paths
