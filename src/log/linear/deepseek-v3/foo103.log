---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop increments `x` from `0` to `100` (exclusive), terminating when `x` reaches `100`. The intended outcome is to ensure `x == 100` after the loop exits.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing condition**: `while (x < 100)`.
  - **Body operation**: `x = x + 1` (increments `x` by `1` per iteration).
  - **Relevant variable**: Only `x` (initialized to `0`).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
| Step          | `x` Value |
|---------------|----------|
| Pre-Loop      | `0`      |
| Post-Iter 1   | `1`      |
| Post-Iter 2   | `2`      |
| Post-Iter 3   | `3`      |
| Post-Iter 4   | `4`      |
| Post-Iter 5   | `5`      |
| ...           | ...      |
| Post-Loop     | `100`    |

**Observations**:
- The loop terminates after the 100th iteration when `x` becomes `100` (falsifying `x < 100`).

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Post-condition**: `assert x == 100`.
- **Can it be an invariant?**  
  **No**, because `x == 100` is only true *after* termination, not during iterations (e.g., `x == 5` mid-loop violates it).
- **Modified Invariant**:  
  Weaker but inductive: `0 <= x <= 100`.  
  - **Establishment**: Holds initially (`x == 0`).  
  - **Preservation**: If `x < 100`, `x+1` keeps `x <= 100`.  
  - **Termination**: When `x >= 100`, combined with loop exit (`x < 100` false), implies `x == 100`.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Proposal**
- **Invariant**: `0 <= x <= 100`.  
- **Validity**:  
  - Initially true (`x == 0`).  
  - Preserved: Each iteration increments `x` by `1`, but stops before exceeding `100`.  
  - At termination, `x == 100` (since `x` increments to `100` and loop exits).

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- **Pre-condition**: `x = 0`.  
- **Invariant holds**: `0 <= 0 <= 100` is trivially true before the loop starts.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- **Assumption**: At iteration start, `0 <= x <= 100` and `x < 100`.  
- **Action**: `x = x + 1`.  
- **Result**:  
  - If `x < 100`, then `x + 1 <= 100` (since `x` at most `99`).  
  - Thus, `0 <= x <= 100` remains true.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- **Termination condition**: `x >= 100` (negation of `x < 100`).  
- **Loop invariant at exit**: `0 <= x <= 100` and `x >= 100` ⇒ `x == 100`.  
- **Why valid**: The loop exits precisely when `x` reaches `100`, satisfying the invariant.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- **Post-condition**: `x == 100`.  
- **Proof**:  
  1. Invariant holds at exit: `0 <= x <= 100` and `x >= 100` ⇒ `x == 100`.  
  2. The loop ensures `x` increments to exactly `100` (no overshoot due to `x < 100` condition).  
- **Conclusion**: The post-condition is **correct**.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**
```c
/*@ loop invariant 0 <= x <= 100; */
while (x < 100) {
    x = x + 1;
}
```
**Explanation**: This invariant captures the bounded progress of `x` and ensures termination at `x == 100`. It is inductive (established, preserved, and implies the post-condition).

### Explanation of the Annotations:
1. **Loop Invariant**:  
   - `0 <= x <= 100`: Ensures that `x` remains within bounds (`0` at start, increments up to `100`).  
   - **Establishment**: Holds initially (`x == 0`).  
   - **Preservation**: If `x < 100`, `x + 1` keeps `x <= 100`.  
   - **Termination**: When loop exits (`x >= 100`), invariant implies `x == 100`.

2. **Loop Assigns**:  
   - `loop assigns x`: Only `x` is modified in the loop body.

3. **Post-condition**:  
   - `assert x == 100`: Directly follows from the invariant and loop exit condition.  

No additional annotations (e.g., `requires`, `ensures`, `loop variant`) are added per the task rules. The invariant is inductive and sufficient for Frama-C verification.

### Key Points:
1. The first invariant `x == \at(x, Pre) + (\at(x, Here) - \at(x, Pre))` establishes the exact relationship between the initial and current value of `x`
2. The second invariant `0 <= x <= 100` provides the bounds verification
3. `loop assigns x` specifies the only variable being modified
4. The post-condition `x == 100` follows directly from the invariants when the loop terminates
5. All annotations use only standard ACSL constructs without variants or additional clauses
6. The solution strictly follows all given rules about placeholder replacement and annotation restrictions

    while (x < 100) {
        x = (x + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert x == 100; */
}
```

Note: The verification goal `x == 100` cannot actually be used as an invariant in this case since it's not true during loop execution (only at termination). Here's the corrected version:

```c
void foo103() {
    int x = 0;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant x <= 100;
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x < 100) {
        x = (x + 1);
    }
    
    /*@ assert x == 100; */
}
```

The correct invariant is `x <= 100` since:
1. It holds initially (x=0)
2. It's preserved by the loop body (x only increases)
3. Combined with loop exit condition (x >= 100), it proves x == 100
