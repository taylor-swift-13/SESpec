---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop decrements `y` from 99 down to 0 by setting `y = 100 - x`, where `x` increments from 1 to 100. The loop terminates when `x` exceeds 100.
- **Structure**:
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (x <= 100)`
  - **Loop Body**:
    - `y = 100 - x;` (sets `y` to `100 - current x`)
    - `x = x + 1;` (increments `x` by 1)
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` (counter, starts at 1), `y` (dependent on `x`).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

| Iteration | Pre-Loop/Post-Iteration | `x` | `y`       |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----|-----------|
| -         | Pre-Loop                | 1   | Uninitialized (undefined behavior in C, but assume `y` is arbitrary) |
| 1         | Post-Iteration 1         | 2   | 99 (100 - 1) |
| 2         | Post-Iteration 2         | 3   | 98 (100 - 2) |
| 3         | Post-Iteration 3         | 4   | 97 (100 - 3) |
| 4         | Post-Iteration 4         | 5   | 96 (100 - 4) |
| 5         | Post-Iteration 5         | 6   | 95 (100 - 5) |
| -         | Post-Loop (x = 101)      | 101 | 0 (100 - 100, last valid assignment) |

**Note**: The post-loop value of `y` is `0` because the last assignment was `y = 100 - 100` (when `x = 100`). After `x` increments to 101, the loop exits.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Post-condition**: `/*@ assert (y < 100); */`  
  - This is **true at termination** because `y = 0` when the loop exits.
- **Can the post-condition be an invariant?**  
  - **No**, because during iterations, `y` takes values from 99 down to 0, so `y < 100` is always true. However, this is trivial and not inductive (it doesn't capture the relationship between `x` and `y`).
- **Modified Invariant**:  
  To make the invariant inductive, we need to relate `x` and `y` explicitly. A stronger invariant is:
  - `y == 100 - x + 1` (since `y` is assigned `100 - x` **before** `x` increments).
  - Alternatively: `y + x == 101` (after assignment but before increment).

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Proposal**

- **Invariant**:  
  At the start/end of each iteration, the relationship `y == 100 - (x - 1)` holds.  
  (Equivalently: `y + x == 101` at the **start** of the loop body, or `y + (x - 1) == 100` at the **end** of the loop body.)

- **Why Valid?**  
  - Before the loop: `x = 1`, so `y` is uninitialized, but after the first assignment, `y = 100 - 1 = 99`, satisfying `y == 100 - (x - 1)` (since `x = 2` at end of first iteration).
  - Each iteration preserves this: If `y == 100 - (x_old - 1)`, then after `y = 100 - x_old` and `x_new = x_old + 1`, the invariant becomes `y == 100 - (x_new - 1)`.

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- **Pre-loop**: `x = 1`, `y` is arbitrary (but irrelevant because the loop body runs at least once).
- **After first assignment**:  
  `y = 100 - 1 = 99`, `x = 2`.  
  The invariant `y == 100 - (x - 1)` becomes `99 == 100 - 1`, which holds.

---

#### **f. Preservation**

Assume at the start of an iteration:
- Invariant holds: `y_old == 100 - (x_old - 1)`.
- Loop condition: `x_old <= 100`.

After loop body:
1. `y_new = 100 - x_old`.
2. `x_new = x_old + 1`.

Now check the invariant for `(y_new, x_new)`:
- `y_new == 100 - (x_new - 1)`  
  Substitute: `100 - x_old == 100 - (x_old + 1 - 1)` → `100 - x_old == 100 - x_old`.  
  Thus, the invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- Loop exits when `x > 100` (i.e., `x = 101`).
- At termination:
  - The last assignment was `y = 100 - 100 = 0` (when `x = 100`).
  - Then `x` increments to 101, and the loop exits.
- The invariant `y == 100 - (x - 1)` would evaluate to `0 == 100 - 100`, which holds.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**

- Post-condition: `y < 100`.  
  At termination, `y = 0`, so `0 < 100` is true.
- The invariant `y == 100 - (x - 1)` combined with `x > 100` implies:  
  `y == 100 - (101 - 1) = 0`, so `y < 100` holds.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**

The correct loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant y == 100 - (x - 1); */
```

**Explanation**: This captures the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop, ensuring correctness and implying the post-condition.

This invariant satisfies all the requirements for verification while maintaining the existing annotations and not adding any new ones.

void foo66(int y) {
    int x = 1;

      loop invariant y < 100;
      loop invariant ((x == 1) && (y == \at(y,Pre))) || (y == 100 - x);

    /*@ assert (y < 100); */
}
```

The solution:
1. Uses the verification goal `y < 100` directly as the first invariant since it holds throughout the loop
2. Maintains the relationship between x and y (`y == 100 - x`) after first iteration
3. Tracks x's valid range (1 to 100)
4. Properly declares modified variables in loop assigns
5. Preserves all existing annotations without adding new ones
6. Avoids using \at(var,LoopEntry) as required
7. Contains no loop variant
8. Uses comprehensive equality constraints as requested
