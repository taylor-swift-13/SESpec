---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop decrements the variable `x` by 1 in each iteration until `x` is no longer greater than 1. The intended outcome is to reduce `x` to 1 if the initial value `n` is at least 1.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (x > 1)`
  - **Loop Body**: `x = x - 1;` (decrements `x` by 1).
  - **Relevant Variables**: 
    - `x`: The loop counter, initialized to `n`.
    - `n`: The input parameter, whose value determines the loop's behavior.

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

Assume `n = 6` (for illustration):

1. **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
   - `x = 6`, `n = 6`.
2. **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
   - After 1st iteration: `x = 5`.
   - After 2nd iteration: `x = 4`.
   - After 3rd iteration: `x = 3`.
   - After 4th iteration: `x = 2`.
   - After 5th iteration: `x = 1`.
3. **Post-Loop Sampling**:
   - Loop terminates after the 5th iteration (since `x = 1` violates `x > 1`). Final state: `x = 1`.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Verification Goal (Post-Condition)**:
  ```c
  /*@ assert (n >= 1) ==> (x == 1); */
  ```
  - This states: "If `n` is at least 1, then after the loop, `x` must be 1."

- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
  - **No**, because the post-condition is only true at termination, not during iterations. For example:
    - During iterations, `x` is greater than 1 (e.g., `x = 5` after the first iteration), so `x == 1` is false.
  - **Modification for a Valid Invariant**:
    - Weaken the post-condition to describe the loop's progress. A suitable invariant is:
      ```c
      /*@ loop invariant x >= 1; */
      ```
      - This holds during iterations (since `x` is always decremented but never below 1) and implies the post-condition at termination.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed Invariant (Natural Language)**:
  - "At the start and end of every iteration, `x` is always greater than or equal to 1."
- **Why It Is Valid**:
  - Before the loop: `x = n`. If `n >= 1`, the invariant holds.
  - During the loop: `x` is decremented by 1, but the loop condition `x > 1` ensures `x` never drops below 2 during iterations. After the final decrement, `x = 1` (which satisfies `x >= 1`).
  - At termination: `x` is 1, so the invariant still holds.

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- **How the Invariant is Established**:
  - Before the loop, `x` is initialized to `n`. If `n >= 1`, then `x >= 1` is true. Thus, the invariant holds at the start.
  - If `n < 1`, the loop never executes (no iterations), and the post-condition is vacuously true (since the premise `n >= 1` is false).

---

#### **f. Preservation**

- **How the Invariant is Preserved**:
  - Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `x >= 1`.
  - The loop condition `x > 1` ensures `x` is at least 2 at the start of the body.
  - After `x = x - 1`, `x` is decremented to `x - 1 >= 1` (since `x > 1`).
  - Thus, the invariant `x >= 1` holds at the end of the iteration.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- **Termination State**:
  - The loop terminates when `x <= 1`. Since the loop condition is `x > 1`, the negation is `x <= 1`.
  - From the invariant `x >= 1` and `x <= 1`, we deduce `x == 1` at termination.
- **Why the Invariant Holds at Termination**:
  - The invariant `x >= 1` is preserved until the loop exits, and the termination condition forces `x == 1`.

---

#### **h. Post-Condition Correctness**

- **Evaluation of Post-Condition**:
  - The post-condition is correct.
  - **Proof**:
    1. From the invariant `x >= 1` and termination condition `x <= 1`, we get `x == 1`.
    2. If `n >= 1`, the loop runs until `x == 1`.
    3. Thus, `(n >= 1) ==> (x == 1)` is satisfied.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**

The correct loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant x >= 1; */
```
This ensures `x` never drops below 1 during execution and implies the post-condition at termination.

1. It holds initially (since `x = n` and if `n >= 1`, the loop executes)
2. It is preserved by each iteration (since we only decrement `x` while `x > 1`)
3. At termination (`x <= 1`), combined with the invariant, gives `x == 1`

The `loop assigns x` annotation specifies that `x` is the only variable modified by the loop.

### Key Points:
1. **First Invariant** (`\at(n,Pre) > 1` case):  
   - `x >= 1` ensures `x` never drops below 1 (safety)  
   - `x <= \at(n,Pre)` captures the decrementing property (progress)

2. **Second Invariant** (when `n <= 1`):  
   - Preserves the pre-condition (`x == n && n == \at(n,Pre)`) since the loop won't execute

3. **Third Invariant**:  
   - Maintains that `n` is unchanged throughout execution

4. **Loop Assigns**:  
   - Only `x` is modified by the loop

The invariants work together to ensure the post-condition `(n >= 1) ==> (x == 1)` holds at termination.

2025-12-27 14:58:48,216 - DEBUG  - Here's the completed C code with the verification goal directly used as part of the loop invariant where possible:

```c
void foo27(int n) {
    int x = n;
    
    /*@
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 1) ==> ((n >= 1) ==> (x >= 1));
      loop invariant (\at(n,Pre) > 1) ==> (x <= \at(n,Pre));
      loop invariant (!(\at(n,Pre) > 1)) ==> ((x == \at(n,Pre)) && (n == \at(n,Pre)));
      loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
      loop assigns x;
    */
    while (x > 1) {
        x = x - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert (n >= 1) ==> (x == 1); */
}
```

Key observations:
1. The verification goal `(n >= 1) ==> (x == 1)` cannot be used directly as an invariant since it's only true at termination
2. Instead, we use a weaker form `(n >= 1) ==> (x >= 1)` which holds throughout the loop
3. We add `x <= \at(n,Pre)` to track the upper bound
4. The case where `n <= 1` preserves the initial conditions
5. `n == \at(n,Pre)` maintains that n is unchanged

This satisfies all requirements while being as strong as possible given the verification goal constraints.
