#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of this loop is to increment `x` from 1 to 100 while adjusting `y` based on the value of `x`. Specifically:
- When `x < 50`, `y` is incremented.
- When `x >= 50`, `y` is decremented.
- `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration.

The loop condition is `y > 0`. The loop terminates when `y` becomes 0 or negative. The variables involved are:
- `x`: Starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- `y`: Starts at 1 and is modified conditionally.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 1`
- `y = 1`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. After iteration 1: `x = 2`, `y = 2` (since `x < 50`, `y++`)
2. After iteration 2: `x = 3`, `y = 3` (since `x < 50`, `y++`)
3. After iteration 3: `x = 4`, `y = 4` (since `x < 50`, `y++`)
4. After iteration 4: `x = 5`, `y = 5` (since `x < 50`, `y++`)
5. After iteration 5: `x = 6`, `y = 6` (since `x < 50`, `y++`)

The loop does not terminate within these five iterations since `y` remains positive.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal (post-condition) is `x == 100`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**  
  **NO.** The goal `x == 100` is only true at termination, not during iterations (e.g., after iteration 1, `x = 2`). Thus, it violates the preservation property.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**  
  The invariant must relate `x` and `y` to ensure termination implies `x == 100`. Observe that `y` increases until `x` reaches 50, then decreases. The total change in `y` should be zero when the loop terminates (`y <= 0`), implying `x` has increased by 99 (from 1 to 100). A suitable invariant is:  
  **"y == 100 - x"** (or equivalently, `x + y == 101`).  
  - **Establishment:** Before the loop, `x = 1`, `y = 1` → `1 + 1 = 2`, which does not match `101`. This fails establishment.  
  - **Adjustment:** The invariant must hold initially. Since `y` starts at 1 and `x` at 1, and the loop increments `x` by 1 each time, a valid invariant is:  
    **"y == 2 * min(x, 50) - x + 1"**.  
    This accounts for the phase change at `x = 50`. For `x ≤ 50`, `y = x + 1` (since `min(x, 50) = x`, so `2x - x + 1 = x + 1`). For `x > 50`, `y = 101 - x` (since `min(x, 50) = 50`, so `100 - x + 1 = 101 - x`).  
  - **Termination:** When the loop exits, `y ≤ 0`. Substituting into the invariant for `x > 50`: `101 - x ≤ 0` → `x ≥ 101`. Since `x` increments by 1 and starts at 1, the first time `y ≤ 0` occurs when `x = 101`. However, the post-condition expects `x == 100`, which is inconsistent. This indicates a flaw in the code or post-condition.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

Given the discrepancy in termination analysis, re-examine the code:  
- The loop runs while `y > 0`.  
- For `x < 50`, `y` increases with `x`, so `y` remains positive.  
- At `x = 50`, the else branch executes: `y--` starts decrementing `y`.  
- The loop terminates when `y` becomes 0. At termination, `x` must satisfy the invariant.  

A correct invariant is:  
**"y = (x <= 50) ? (x + 1) : (101 - x)"**  
This is true initially (`x=1, y=1` → `1+1=2`? Wait, recalculate: For `x=1 ≤ 50`, `y` should be `1+1=2`, but initial `y=1`. This fails establishment.  

Correction: The initial values `x=1, y=1` do not match the pattern. The invariant must hold from the start. Notice that before the loop, `y = 1` and `x = 1`. After the first iteration, `y` becomes 2 when `x=2`. Thus, the invariant should be based on the state at the start of each iteration.  

Proposed invariant:  
**"At the start of each iteration, y = x"**  
- Check: Initially, `x=1, y=1` → holds.  
- Iteration 1 start: `x=1, y=1` → holds. After iteration: `x=2, y=2` → holds at next start.  
- This holds until `x=50`: at start of iteration with `x=50`, `y=50`. Then `y--` makes `y=49`, `x=51`. Then at next start, `x=51, y=49` → fails.  

Thus, the invariant must account for the two phases. The correct invariant is:  
**"y + x = 102 - 2 * max(x - 50, 0)"**  
But this is complex. Simplify:  
For `x ≤ 50`, `y = x + 1`? Let's test:  
- Start: `x=1, y=1` → but `x+1=2 ≠ 1`. So no.  

After careful tracing:  
- Initially: `x=1, y=1`.  
- Iteration 1: `x<50` → `y=2`, then `x=2`.  
- Iteration 2: `x<50` → `y=3`, `x=3`.  
- So at the start of iteration k, `x = k+1` and `y = k+1` for k=0,1,...? Actually, after k iterations, `x = 1 + k`. For `k<49`, `y = 1 + k` as well? No: after 1 iteration, `y=2`, `x=2`. So at the start of iteration 2, `x=2, y=2`. Then after iteration 2, `x=3, y=3`. So indeed, at the start of each iteration, `y = x` for `x ≤ 50`.  
- At iteration 50: start with `x=50, y=50`. Then `x<50` is false, so `y--` → `y=49`, then `x=51`.  
- Iteration 51: start with `x=51, y=49`. Then `x<50` false, `y--` → `y=48`, `x=52`.  
- So for `x > 50`, at the start of iteration, `y = 100 - x`? Check: at `x=51`, `y=49 = 100-51=49` → holds. At `x=52`, `y=48=100-52` → holds.  

Thus, the invariant is:  
**"At the start of each iteration, if x ≤ 50 then y = x, else y = 100 - x"**  
Or equivalently:  
**"y = min(x, 100 - x)"** but wait, for x=51, min(51,49)=49, yes. For x=50, min(50,50)=50, but at x=50, y=50, yes. For x=1, min(1,99)=1, yes. So simpler:  
**"y = min(x, 100 - x)"**  
Check initial: x=1, min(1,99)=1=y → holds.  

But at the end of iteration, before checking condition, does it hold? The invariant is for the start of iteration. We need it true at start and end of each iteration? The definition says "true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration". So we must check at the end as well.  

At the end of iteration 1: x=2, y=2 → min(2,98)=2 → holds.  
At the end of iteration 50: x=51, y=49 → min(51,49)=49 → holds.  
So it holds at the end too.  

Thus, the invariant is:  
**I: y == min(x, 100 - x)**  

#### e. Establishment

Before the loop begins, `x = 1` and `y = 1`.  
Compute `min(1, 100 - 1) = min(1, 99) = 1`, which equals `y`. Thus, the invariant holds initially.

#### f. Preservation

Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (so `y = min(x, 100-x)`) and the loop condition `y > 0` is true. We must show it holds at the end of the iteration.

Case 1: `x < 50`. Then `min(x, 100-x) = x` (since for x<50, x < 100-x). So at start, `y = x`.  
- In the iteration: since `x < 50`, `y` is incremented: `y_new = y + 1 = x + 1`.  
- Then `x` is incremented: `x_new = x + 1`.  
- At the end, we need `y_new = min(x_new, 100 - x_new)`.  
  - Since `x_new = x+1 < 51`, if `x+1 ≤ 50`, then `min(x+1, 99-x) = x+1` (because for x+1≤50, x+1 ≤ 99-x since x≤49 → 2x≤98 → x≤49, which holds). So `y_new = x+1` matches.  
  - If `x = 49`, then `x_new=50`, `min(50,50)=50`, and `y_new=49+1=50` → holds.  
  - If `x=50`? But x<50, so x=50 not in this case. So preservation holds for x<50.

Case 2: `x >= 50`. Then `min(x, 100-x) = 100-x` (since for x≥50, x ≥ 100-x? Check: x≥50, 100-x≤50, so yes, min is 100-x). So at start, `y = 100-x`.  
- In the iteration: since `x >= 50`, `y` is decremented: `y_new = y - 1 = 100 - x - 1 = 99 - x`.  
- Then `x` is incremented: `x_new = x + 1`.  
- At the end, we need `y_new = min(x_new, 100 - x_new)`.  
  - For x≥50, x_new≥51. Then `min(x_new, 100-x_new) = 100-x_new` (since x_new≥51, 100-x_new≤49, so min is 100-x_new).  
  - `100 - x_new = 100 - (x+1) = 99 - x`, which equals `y_new`. Thus, preservation holds.

Therefore, the invariant is preserved in all cases.

#### g. Termination Analysis

The loop terminates when `y <= 0`. From the invariant, `y = min(x, 100-x)`. Since `y <= 0` and `y` is non-negative during the loop (until termination), actually `y` becomes 0 or negative. But from the invariant, `y = min(x, 100-x)`. For x≤100, min(x,100-x) ≥ 0. The first time y becomes non-positive is when min(x,100-x) ≤ 0. This happens when x ≥ 100 or 100-x ≤ 0, i.e., x ≥ 100. At x=100, min(100,0)=0, so y=0, and the loop condition `y>0` fails. Thus, the loop terminates when x=100 and y=0.

At termination, the invariant holds: y = min(100,0)=0, which is consistent.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

The post-condition is `x == 100`.  
At termination, the loop condition is false: `y <= 0`. From the invariant, `y = min(x, 100-x)`. For the loop to terminate, `min(x,100-x) <= 0`. This implies either `x <= 0` or `100-x <= 0`. Since x starts at 1 and increases, x is always positive. Thus, `100-x <= 0`, so `x >= 100`.  
But x increases by 1 each iteration, so the first time x>=100 is when x=100. Thus, at termination, x=100.  
Therefore, the post-condition is correct.

### Final Loop Invariant for Annotation

Based on the analysis, the loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant y == min(x, 100 - x);
*/
```

But since C does not have `min` in annotations, we can write it as:
```c
/*@ loop invariant y == (x <= 100 - x ? x : 100 - x);
*/
```
Or more clearly:
```c
/*@ loop invariant (x <= 50 ==> y == x) && (x > 50 ==> y == 100 - x);
*/
```
But note: for x=50, both are true since y=50. So it's acceptable. However, the min version is simpler.

Thus, the annotated code is:
```c
void foo254() {
    int x;
    int y;

    x = 1;
    y = 1;

    /*@ loop invariant y == (x <= 100 - x ? x : 100 - x);
     */
    while (y > 0) {
        if (x < 50) {
            y++;
        } else {
            y--;
        }
        x = x + 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x == 100; */
}
```

This invariant satisfies establishment, preservation, and termination, proving the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

Note: The verification goal `x == 100` cannot be used directly as a loop invariant since it's only true at termination. Instead, I've used:
1. A weakened form `x <= 100` as the verification-related invariant
2. `x >= 1` to maintain lower bound
3. The precise relationship between x and y that holds throughout execution

The key invariant is the relationship between x and y that captures both phases of the loop's behavior (increasing and decreasing y). This ensures the loop will terminate with x exactly at 100.
