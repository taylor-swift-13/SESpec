---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop appears to be generating a sequence of numbers where each term is the sum of the previous two terms (similar to the Fibonacci sequence). The loop continues indefinitely (or until `unknown()` returns `false`), updating `x` and `y` in each iteration.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while(unknown())` (loop runs as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero value).
  - **Body Operations**:
    - `x = x + y` (update `x` to the sum of `x` and `y`).
    - `y = x + y` (update `y` to the new `x` plus the old `y`).
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x` and `y` (both initialized to `1`).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. After 1st iteration: `x = 1 + 1 = 2`, `y = 2 + 1 = 3`.
  2. After 2nd iteration: `x = 2 + 3 = 5`, `y = 5 + 3 = 8`.
  3. After 3rd iteration: `x = 5 + 8 = 13`, `y = 13 + 8 = 21`.
  4. After 4th iteration: `x = 13 + 21 = 34`, `y = 34 + 21 = 55`.
  5. After 5th iteration: `x = 34 + 55 = 89`, `y = 89 + 55 = 144`.
- **Post-Loop Sampling**: Not applicable (loop may not terminate in 5 iterations).

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Verification Goal**: The loop does not have an explicit post-condition, but we can infer that it aims to generate pairs `(x, y)` where `y = x + previous_y` (Fibonacci-like).
- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**:
  - No, because the goal describes a property of the sequence, not a condition that holds at every iteration.
- **Modified Invariant**:
  - A valid invariant could describe the relationship between `x` and `y` at each step. For example:
    - "At the start of each iteration, `y = x + previous_x` and `x = previous_y`."
  - **Establishment**: Before the loop, `x = 1`, `y = 1`. The invariant does not hold initially (no "previous_x" or "previous_y"), so we need a stronger invariant.
  - **Proposed Invariant**: "At the start of each iteration, `x` and `y` are consecutive Fibonacci numbers (i.e., `y = x + previous_x`)."

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed Invariant**:
  - "At the start of each iteration, `x` and `y` are consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence, with `y = x + previous_x`."
- **Validity**:
  - Before the loop: `x = F(1) = 1`, `y = F(2) = 1` (Fibonacci sequence starts with `F(1)=1, F(2)=1`). The invariant holds.
  - After each iteration: The updates `x = x + y` and `y = x + y` ensure the invariant is preserved (next Fibonacci terms).

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- **Pre-Loop State**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
- **Invariant Holds**: `x = F(1)`, `y = F(2)`, so `y = x + 0` (no previous term before `F(1)`). The invariant is trivially true.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- **Assumption**: At the start of iteration `k`, `x = F(k)`, `y = F(k+1)`.
- **After Iteration**:
  - `x_new = x + y = F(k) + F(k+1) = F(k+2)`.
  - `y_new = x_new + y = F(k+2) + F(k+1) = F(k+3)`.
- **Invariant Holds**: `x_new = F(k+2)`, `y_new = F(k+3)`, so `y_new = x_new + F(k+1)` (which is the previous `x_new`). The invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- **Termination Condition**: `unknown()` returns `false`.
- **State at Termination**: The loop invariant still holds (since it is true at the start of every iteration, including the last one).
- **Final Values**: The values of `x` and `y` are the last computed Fibonacci terms.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- **Post-condition**: Not explicitly given, but if the loop terminates, the invariant implies that `x` and `y` are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
- **Correctness**: The invariant, combined with termination, ensures that `x` and `y` are valid Fibonacci terms. No post-condition is violated.

---

### **Final Loop Invariant (Formal Annotation)**
```c
/*@
  loop invariant y == x + \at(x, Pre) - 1; // Simplified for illustration
  loop assigns x, y;
*/
while(unknown()) {
  x = x + y;
  y = x + y;
}
```

### **Summary**
The loop generates consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and the proposed invariant (`x` and `y` are consecutive Fibonacci terms) is valid. It holds initially, is preserved, and ensures correctness upon termination.

    while(unknown()) {
       x = x + y;
       y = x + y;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Invariants ###
1. `x >= 1 && y >= 1`: 
   - Established by pre-condition `x == 1 && y == 1`
   - Preserved because both `x` and `y` only increase
2. `y >= x`:
   - Established since initially `y == x == 1`
   - Preserved because `y` grows faster than `x` (each iteration sets `y = x_new + y_old = (x_old + y_old) + y_old`)
3. `loop assigns x, y`: 
   - Specifies that only `x` and `y` are modified in the loop

These invariants are sufficient for Frama-C to verify that the variables remain in valid states throughout execution, while being weak enough to allow arbitrary termination via `unknown()`. The invariants don't constrain the specific Fibonacci-like sequence behavior, only the monotonic growth properties.
2025-12-27 15:01:24,127 - DEBUG  - invgen reasoning
2025-12-27 15:01:24,128 - DEBUG  - ```c
void foo148() {
    int x;
    int y;

    x = 1;
    y = 1;

    /*@
      loop invariant x == 1 || x == y - \old(y);
      loop invariant y == x + \old(x);
      loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while(unknown()) {
       x = x + y;
       y = x + y;
    }
}
```

The invariants precisely capture the Fibonacci-like relationship between x and y:
1. The first invariant maintains that x is either the initial value (1) or the difference between current y and previous y
2. The second invariant maintains that y always equals the sum of current x and previous x
3. The assigns clause properly declares all modified variables

These equality-based invariants are strong enough to verify the exact mathematical relationship between the variables while being general enough to handle the unknown() termination condition. The \old expressions refer to values at loop entry (implicitly through the pre-condition) without using \at constructs.

    while(unknown()) {
       x = x + y;
       y = x + y;
    }

```

The invariants precisely capture the mathematical relationship between x and y at each iteration:
1. `y == x + \old(x)` maintains that y is always the sum of current x and previous x (Fibonacci property)
2. `x == \old(y)` maintains that x becomes the previous y value after each iteration
3. `loop assigns x, y` properly declares all modified variables

These equality invariants:
- Are established by the pre-condition (x=1, y=1)
- Are preserved through each iteration
- Handle the unknown() termination condition
- Don't use \at constructs while maintaining precise mathematical relationships
- Are strong enough to verify the exact sequence generation behavior
