---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop decrements both `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration until `x` equals `n` (which is initialized to 0). The intended outcome is to ensure that when the loop terminates, `y` also equals `n` (i.e., `x == n` implies `y == n`).
- **Structure**:
  - **Loop Condition**: `while (x != n)` (loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to `n`).
  - **Loop Body**: Decrements `x` and `y` by 1 (`x = x - 1; y = y - 1;`).
  - **Relevant Variables**: `x`, `y`, `n` (where `n` is fixed at 0).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

Assume the initial values satisfy the pre-condition: `x = y = k` (where `k >= 0`).

| Iteration | Pre-Loop/Post-Iteration State | `x` | `y` | `n` | Loop Condition (`x != n`) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------------------|
| Pre-Loop  | Before loop starts             | `k` | `k` | `0` | `true` (if `k != 0`)       |
| 1         | After 1st iteration            | `k-1` | `k-1` | `0` | `true` (if `k-1 != 0`)     |
| 2         | After 2nd iteration            | `k-2` | `k-2` | `0` | `true` (if `k-2 != 0`)     |
| ...       | ...                            | ... | ... | ... | ...                       |
| m         | After m-th iteration           | `k-m` | `k-m` | `0` | `false` (when `k-m == 0`)  |

- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `x == n` (i.e., `x = 0`). At this point, `y` is also `0` because `x` and `y` are decremented equally.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Verification Goal (Post-condition)**: `(x == n) ==> (y == n)`.
- **Can the Verification Goal Be an Invariant?**
  - **No**, because the verification goal is only required to hold when the loop terminates (`x == n`). During iterations, `x != n`, so the implication is vacuously true but does not provide useful information about the relationship between `x` and `y`.
- **Modified Invariant**:
  - To ensure the post-condition, the invariant must capture the relationship between `x` and `y` during the loop. The key observation is that `x` and `y` are always equal because they start equal and are decremented equally.
  - **Proposed Invariant**: `x == y`.
    - **Establishment**: Holds initially because `x == y` (from pre-condition).
    - **Preservation**: If `x == y` at the start of an iteration, then after decrementing both, `x' = x - 1` and `y' = y - 1`, so `x' == y'`.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates (`x == n`), the invariant `x == y` implies `y == n`, which proves the post-condition.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed Invariant**: `x == y`.
- **Explanation**:
  - The invariant holds before the loop starts (pre-condition ensures `x == y`).
  - Each iteration preserves the equality because both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1.
  - At termination, `x == n` and `x == y` imply `y == n`, satisfying the post-condition.

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- Before the loop starts:
  - Pre-condition: `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `x == y`.
  - `n` is initialized to `0`.
  - Thus, `x == y` holds initially, satisfying the invariant.

---

#### **f. Preservation**

- At the start of an iteration:
  - Assume `x == y` holds and `x != n` (loop condition is true).
  - Loop body: `x = x - 1; y = y - 1;`.
  - After the iteration: `x' = x - 1`, `y' = y - 1`.
  - Since `x == y` before the iteration, `x' == y'` after the iteration.
  - Thus, the invariant `x == y` is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- Loop terminates when `x == n` (i.e., `x == 0`).
- At termination:
  - Invariant `x == y` still holds.
  - Thus, `y == n` (since `x == n`).
- The post-condition `(x == n) ==> (y == n)` is satisfied because `x == n` and `y == n` are both true.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**

- **Post-condition**: `(x == n) ==> (y == n)`.
- **Correctness**:
  - The invariant `x == y` ensures that `y` mirrors `x` throughout the loop.
  - At termination, `x == n` and `x == y` imply `y == n`.
  - Thus, the post-condition is correct and is proven by the invariant.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**

The loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant x == y; */
```

This invariant holds because:
1. It is established by the pre-condition `x == y`.
2. It is preserved because `x` and `y` are decremented equally in each iteration.
3. At termination, it ensures the post-condition `(x == n) ==> (y == n)`.

```c
/*@
    requires x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x == y;
    */
    
void foo174(int x, int y) {

    int n;

    n = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant x == y;
          loop assigns x, y;
            */
            while(x != n){
       x = x - 1;
       y = y - 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert (x == n) ==> (y == n); */

  }
```

The loop invariant `x == y` is sufficient because:
1. It is established by the pre-condition `x == y`
2. It is preserved since both `x` and `y` are decremented equally in each iteration
3. It implies the post-condition when combined with the loop exit condition `x == n`

The `loop assigns` annotation specifies that only `x` and `y` are modified by the loop.

    int n;

    n = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

          loop invariant (!(\at(x,Pre) != 0)) ==> ((n == 0)&&(y == \at(y,Pre))&&(x == \at(x,Pre)));
          loop invariant n == 0;

            */
            while(x != n){

       y = y - 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert (x == n) ==> (y == n); */

  }
```

The invariants maintain:
1. The relationship between current x/y values and their initial values when x was non-zero initially
2. The preservation of initial values when x was zero initially (loop doesn't execute)
3. The constant value of n
4. The variables being modified by the loop

These invariants satisfy all the requirements while being as comprehensive as possible about the equality constraints throughout the loop's execution.

2025-12-27 14:31:23,671 - DEBUG  - Here is the completed C code with the verification goal used directly as part of the loop invariant:

```c

    n = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (\at(x,Pre) != 0) ==> ((x == n) ==> (y == n));

          loop invariant (\at(x,Pre) != 0) ==> (y == \at(y,Pre) - (\at(y,Pre) - n));
          loop invariant (!(\at(x,Pre) != 0)) ==> ((n == 0)&&(y == \at(y,Pre))&&(x == \at(x,Pre)));
          loop invariant n == 0;
          loop assigns x, y;
            */
            while(x != n){

       y = y - 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert (x == n) ==> (y == n); */

  }
```

The key aspects of this solution are:

1. The verification goal `(x == n) ==> (y == n)` is used directly as part of the loop invariant when the initial x is non-zero
2. Additional invariants track the exact relationship between current and initial values of x and y
3. The case where initial x is zero is handled separately
4. The constant value of n is maintained
5. The loop's variable modifications are properly specified

This satisfies all requirements while being maximally comprehensive about the equality constraints throughout execution.
