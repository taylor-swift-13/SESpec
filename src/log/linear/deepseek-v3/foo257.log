---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**

- **Purpose**: The loop decrements the variable `x` from its initial value (40) down to 0. The intended outcome is to ensure `x == 0` upon termination.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (x != 0)`  
    The loop continues as long as `x` is not zero.
  - **Loop Body**: `x = x - 1;`  
    Each iteration decrements `x` by 1.
  - **Relevant Variables**: Only `x` (initialized to 40).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**

| Sample Point       | `x` Value |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Pre-Loop           | 40        |
| Post-Iteration 1   | 39        |
| Post-Iteration 2   | 38        |
| Post-Iteration 3   | 37        |
| Post-Iteration 4   | 36        |
| Post-Iteration 5   | 35        |
| Post-Loop (Final)  | 0         |

**Observations**:
- The loop terminates when `x` reaches 0 (after 40 iterations).
- The sampled values confirm the loop decrements `x` linearly.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**

- **Verification Goal**: `assert x == 0` (post-condition).
- **Can the Goal Be an Invariant?**  
  **NO**, because `x == 0` is only true at termination. During iterations, `x` ranges from 40 down to 1, violating the invariant requirement of being true at every iteration's start/end.
- **Modified Invariant Proposal**:  
  Use `x >= 0` (weaker than `x == 0` but true throughout execution).  
  - **Establishment**: Holds initially (`x == 40 >= 0`).  
  - **Preservation**: If `x >= 0` and `x != 0`, then `x - 1 >= 0` (since `x` is an integer).  
  - **Termination**: When `x == 0`, `x >= 0` still holds, implying the post-condition.

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**

- **Proposed Invariant**:  
  `x >= 0`  
  - **Natural Language**: "The value of `x` is always non-negative."
- **Validity**:  
  - True initially (`x = 40`).  
  - Preserved because decrementing `x` by 1 (from `x > 0`) keeps `x >= 0`.  
  - Holds at termination (`x == 0`).

---

#### **e. Establishment**

- **Pre-condition**: `x == 40` (explicitly set before the loop).  
- **Invariant Holds**: `40 >= 0` is true, satisfying the invariant before the first iteration.

---

#### **f. Preservation**

1. **Assumptions**:  
   - At iteration start: `x >= 0` (invariant) and `x != 0` (loop condition).  
   - Thus, `x > 0` (since `x` is integer).  
2. **After Decrement**: `x_new = x - 1`.  
   - Since `x > 0`, `x_new >= 0`.  
   - Example: If `x = 5`, then `x_new = 4 >= 0`.  
3. **Conclusion**: The invariant `x >= 0` is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**

- **Termination Condition**: `x == 0` (negation of `x != 0`).  
- **Final State**:  
  - Invariant `x >= 0` holds (`0 >= 0`).  
  - Loop condition `x != 0` is false.  
- **Implication**: The post-condition `x == 0` is satisfied.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**

- **Provided Post-condition**: `assert x == 0`.  
- **Correctness**: **YES**.  
  - **Proof**:  
    1. Invariant at termination: `x >= 0`.  
    2. Loop exits when `x == 0`.  
    3. Thus, `x == 0` is directly proven.  

---

### Final Answer: Loop Invariant Annotation

```c
void foo257() {
    int x;
    x = 40;

    /*@ loop invariant x >= 0; */
    while (x != 0) {
        x = x - 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x == 0; */
}
```

**Explanation**: The invariant `x >= 0` is inductively valid (established, preserved, and terminating), ensuring the post-condition `x == 0` holds.

The loop invariant `x == 40 - \count` precisely captures the relationship between the loop counter and the value of x, where `\count` represents the number of completed iterations. This satisfies all requirements:
1. Initially true (when `\count == 0`, `x == 40`)
2. Preserved through each iteration (decrementing x increases `\count` by 1)
3. Leads directly to the post-condition (when loop exits, `x == 0` and `\count == 40`)

The `loop assigns x` annotation specifies that x is the only variable modified by the loop.

    while (x != 0) {
        x = x - 1;
    }

    /*@ assert x == 0; */
}
```

The solution provides two invariants:
1. `x == 0 || x > 0` - Ensures x is never negative during execution
2. `x <= 40` - Maintains the upper bound from the pre-condition

The `loop assigns x` annotation specifies that x is the only modified variable. These invariants:
- Are established by the pre-condition x == 40
- Are preserved through each iteration
- Imply the post-condition x == 0 when combined with the loop exit condition

The verification goal (x == 0) cannot be used directly as an invariant since it's only true at termination, not during execution. The provided invariants are the strongest possible while remaining true throughout execution.
