---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop decrements both `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration until `x` becomes 0. The intended outcome is to reduce `x` to 0 while maintaining a relationship between the initial values of `x` and `y` (`i` and `j`) and their final values.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing condition**: `while (x != 0)` (loop runs as long as `x` is not 0).
  - **Operations in the body**:
    - `x = x - 1` (decrement `x` by 1).
    - `y = y - 1` (decrement `y` by 1).
  - **Relevant variables**:
    - `x`: Loop counter, decremented until 0.
    - `y`: Decremented in sync with `x`.
    - `i`: Initial value of `x` (saved at the start).
    - `j`: Initial value of `y` (saved at the start).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
Assume initial values: `x = 3`, `y = 5` (so `i = 3`, `j = 5`).

| Iteration | Pre-Loop/Post-Iteration | `x` | `y` | `i` | `j` |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| -         | Pre-Loop                | 3   | 5   | 3   | 5   |
| 1         | Post-Iteration          | 2   | 4   | 3   | 5   |
| 2         | Post-Iteration          | 1   | 3   | 3   | 5   |
| 3         | Post-Iteration          | 0   | 2   | 3   | 5   |
| 4         | (Loop terminates)       | -   | -   | -   | -   |

(No 4th or 5th iteration since the loop terminates after 3 iterations.)

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Post-condition**: `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)` (if `y` is not 0 at the end, then `i` and `j` were initially unequal).
- **Can the post-condition be an invariant?**  
  No, because the post-condition depends on the final state of `y` and the initial values `i` and `j`. It is not preserved during iterations (e.g., after the first iteration, `y = 4`, `i = 3`, `j = 5`, so `(4 != 0) ==> (3 != 5)` is true, but this is not useful for proving correctness mid-loop).
- **Modified invariant**:  
  The invariant should relate the current values of `x` and `y` to their initial values (`i` and `j`). A suitable invariant is:
  - `y - x == j - i` (the difference between `y` and `x` is constant and equal to the initial difference `j - i`).

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed invariant**:  
  `y - x == j - i`  
  This states that the difference between `y` and `x` remains equal to the initial difference between `j` and `i` throughout the loop.
- **Why it is valid**:
  - Before the loop: `y - x = j - i` (since `x = i` and `y = j`).
  - During the loop: Both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1, so `y - x` remains unchanged.
  - At termination: The invariant still holds, and the post-condition can be derived from it.

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- Before the loop, `x = i` and `y = j`, so:
  `y - x = j - i`.  
  Thus, the invariant holds trivially before the first iteration.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- Assume the invariant holds at the start of an iteration: `y - x == j - i`.
- After one iteration:
  - `x' = x - 1`, `y' = y - 1`.
  - Compute new difference: `y' - x' = (y - 1) - (x - 1) = y - x`.
  - Thus, `y' - x' == j - i`, so the invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- The loop terminates when `x == 0`.
- At termination:
  - From the invariant: `y - 0 == j - i` ⇒ `y == j - i`.
  - The post-condition is `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)`.  
    Substituting `y == j - i`:  
    `(j - i != 0) ==> (i != j)`, which is tautologically true.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- The post-condition is correct.  
- At termination:
  - If `y != 0`, then `j - i != 0` (from the invariant), so `i != j`.
  - The invariant and termination condition imply the post-condition.

---

### **Final Answer: Loop Invariant**
The correct loop invariant is:
```c
/*@ loop invariant y - x == j - i; */
```

This ensures that the difference between `y` and `x` remains constant throughout the loop, which is key to proving the post-condition.

### Explanation of the Invariant: ###
1. **Invariant `y - x == j - i`**:  
   - At the start of the loop, `x = i` and `y = j`, so `y - x = j - i`.  
   - Each iteration decrements both `x` and `y` by 1, preserving the difference `y - x`.  
   - Thus, the invariant holds throughout the loop.

2. **Loop Assigns `x, y`**:  
   - Only `x` and `y` are modified in the loop body.  

3. **Post-condition `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)`**:  
   - When the loop terminates, `x = 0`.  
   - From the invariant, `y - 0 = j - i` ⇒ `y = j - i`.  
   - If `y != 0`, then `j - i != 0` ⇒ `i != j`.  

This satisfies the verification goal.

        y = y - 1;
    }
  
    /*@ assert (y != 0) ==> (i != j); */
}
```

The invariants maintain:
1. Relationship between current x and initial x when loop executes
2. Relationship between current y and initial y when loop executes
3. Preservation of initial values when loop doesn't execute
4. Constant values of j and i throughout
5. Explicitly lists modified variables (x,y)

The expressions (\at(x,Pre) - x) tracks the number of iterations completed, maintaining precise relationships between initial and current values. This satisfies all verification requirements while strictly following the given constraints.

```

The key aspects are:
1. The verification goal `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)` is used directly as an invariant when the loop executes
2. Precise tracking of x and y values through the loop iterations
3. Preservation of initial values when the loop doesn't execute
4. Explicit declaration of modified variables
5. All invariants are expressed purely in terms of equality constraints as required

This satisfies all verification requirements while strictly following the given constraints and using the verification goal directly as part of the invariant.
