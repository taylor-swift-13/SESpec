---

#### **a. Loop Purpose and Structure**
- **Purpose**: The loop increments `i` by either 8 or 4 (depending on the result of `unknown()`) until `i` reaches or exceeds `50000001`. The goal is to observe how `i` grows and whether the post-condition holds after termination.
- **Structure**:
  - **Governing Condition**: `while (i < 50000001)`.
  - **Body Operations**: 
    - Calls `unknown()` (a non-deterministic function, possibly returning a boolean).
    - If `unknown()` is true, `i` is incremented by 8; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 4.
  - **Relevant Variables**: Only `i` is modified; `j` is unused (but appears in the post-condition).

---

#### **b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values**
Assume `unknown()` alternates between true and false (for illustration).

| Iteration | Pre-`i` | `unknown()` | Post-`i` |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Pre-Loop  | 0      | -           | -       |
| 1         | 0      | true        | 8       |
| 2         | 8      | false       | 12      |
| 3         | 12     | true        | 20      |
| 4         | 20     | false       | 24      |
| 5         | 24     | true        | 32      |

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: If the loop terminates (e.g., `i >= 50000001`), the final value of `i` is sampled.

---

#### **c. Verification Goal Analysis**
- **Post-condition**: `j == (i / 4) ==> ((j * 4))`  
  (This is syntactically incorrect; likely intended: `i % 4 == 0` or similar.)
  
- **Analysis**:
  - The post-condition is unrelated to the loop's behavior (since `j` is never modified). It seems to check if `i` is divisible by 4, but this is not guaranteed because `i` can increase by 8 or 4.
  - **Cannot be used as an invariant**: The post-condition is only meaningful at termination, not during iterations (since `i` may not be divisible by 4 mid-loop).
  - **Modified Invariant**: A valid invariant could be:  
    `i % 4 == 0` (since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 4 or 8, preserving divisibility by 4).

---

#### **d. Loop Invariant Discussion**
- **Proposed Invariant**:  
  `i % 4 == 0` (i.e., `i` is always divisible by 4 at the start/end of each iteration).
- **Validity**:
  - **Establishment**: Holds initially (`i = 0`, and `0 % 4 == 0`).
  - **Preservation**: If `i % 4 == 0` at the start of an iteration, then:
    - If `i += 8`, then `(i + 8) % 4 == 0`.
    - If `i += 4`, then `(i + 4) % 4 == 0`.
  - **Termination**: Holds when the loop exits.

---

#### **e. Establishment**
- **Pre-condition**: `i = 0`.
- **Invariant Holds**: `0 % 4 == 0` is true before the first iteration.

---

#### **f. Preservation**
- Assume `i % 4 == 0` at the start of an iteration.
  - Case 1: `unknown()` is true → `i += 8`.  
    Then `(i + 8) % 4 = (i % 4) + (8 % 4) = 0 + 0 = 0`.
  - Case 2: `unknown()` is false → `i += 4`.  
    Then `(i + 4) % 4 = (i % 4) + (4 % 4) = 0 + 0 = 0`.
- Thus, the invariant is preserved.

---

#### **g. Termination Analysis**
- **Termination Condition**: `i >= 50000001`.
- **Invariant Holds**: Since `i % 4 == 0` is preserved, it remains true at termination.
- **Final State**: `i` is divisible by 4, but the exact value depends on `unknown()`.

---

#### **h. Post-condition Correctness**
- **Post-condition**: The given post-condition is incorrect because:
  1. `j` is unmodified (always indeterminate).
  2. The implication `j == (i / 4) ==> (j * 4)` is trivial (since `j * 4` is always true if `j == i / 4`).
- **Correct Post-condition**: If the goal is to ensure `i` is divisible by 4 at exit, the post-condition should be `i % 4 == 0`.
- **Proof**: The invariant `i % 4 == 0` holds at termination, so the corrected post-condition is satisfied.

---

### **Final Answer**
- **Loop Invariant**:  
  ```c
  /*@ loop invariant i % 4 == 0; */
  ```
- **Corrected Post-condition**:  
  ```c
  /*@ assert i % 4 == 0; */
  ```
- **Summary**: The loop preserves `i % 4 == 0`, but the original post-condition is flawed. The corrected post-condition is proven by the invariant.

The loop invariant includes:
1. `i % 4 == 0` - Since i starts at 0 and only increases by multiples of 4 (either +4 or +8)
2. `i >= 0` - Since i starts at 0 and only increases
3. `i <= 50000001` - Since the loop condition ensures i never exceeds this value

The `loop assigns` clause specifies that only i is modified by the loop. The post-condition about j is preserved since j is never modified in the loop.

2025-12-27 11:40:36,716 - DEBUG  - ```c
void foo302() {
    int i;
    int j;

    i = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant j == (i / 4) ==> (j * 4);
      loop invariant i % 4 == 0 && i >= 0 && i <= 50000001;
      loop assigns i;
    */
    while(i < 50000001) {
       if(unknown())
           i = i + 8;
       else
           i = i + 4;
    }

    /*@ assert (j == (i / 4) ==> ((j * 4))); */
}
```

The loop invariants include:
1. The verification goal `j == (i / 4) ==> (j * 4)` as the first invariant since it holds throughout the loop (as j is never modified)
2. `i % 4 == 0` since i starts at 0 and only increases by multiples of 4
3. `i >= 0` since i starts at 0 and only increases
4. `i <= 50000001` since the loop condition ensures i never exceeds this value

The `loop assigns` clause correctly specifies that only i is modified by the loop. The post-condition is identical to the first loop invariant, ensuring it holds at exit.
