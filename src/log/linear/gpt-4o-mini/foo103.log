#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value of `0` to `100`. The intended outcome is that after the loop finishes executing, `x` will be equal to `100`.

- **Structure**: The loop is governed by the condition `while (x < 100)`, meaning it will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `100`. The body of the loop consists of a single operation: `x = (x + 1)`, which increments `x` by `1` during each iteration. The relevant variable for the loop's behavior is `x`, which starts at `0` and is incremented until it reaches `100`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - Before the loop starts: `x = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After iteration 1: `x = 1`
  - After iteration 2: `x = 2`
  - After iteration 3: `x = 3`
  - After iteration 4: `x = 4`
  - After iteration 5: `x = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - After the loop terminates: `x = 100`

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The verification goal is to prove that `x == 100` after the loop terminates.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it is only true at termination (when the loop condition becomes false), not during iterations.

- **Modification for a valid invariant**:
  - A valid loop invariant could be `x >= 0 && x <= 100`. This modified invariant can be analyzed as follows:
    - **Establishment**: Before the loop starts, `x = 0`, which satisfies `x >= 0 && x <= 100`.
    - **Preservation**: If `x >= 0 && x <= 100` holds at the beginning of an iteration and the loop condition `x < 100` is true, then after the iteration `x` will be incremented by `1`, thus `x` will still satisfy `x >= 0` and `x <= 100`.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` must be `100`, satisfying `x >= 0 && x <= 100`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x >= 0 && x <= 100`.

- **Explanation of Validity**: This invariant is valid because:
  - It is true before the first iteration (when `x = 0`).
  - During each iteration, `x` is incremented, and since the loop condition ensures that `x` will never exceed `100` during execution, the invariant holds throughout.
  - Upon termination, when `x` equals `100`, the invariant still holds true.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: The proposed invariant `x >= 0 && x <= 100` is established as follows:
  - At the beginning of the loop, `x` is initialized to `0`. Thus, `0 >= 0` and `0 <= 100`, confirming that the invariant holds before the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant**: 
  - Assume the invariant `x >= 0 && x <= 100` holds at the start of an iteration, and the loop condition `x < 100` is true.
  - After executing `x = (x + 1)`, the new value of `x` becomes `x + 1`. Since `x` was less than `100`, `x + 1` will be less than or equal to `100`, maintaining the upper bound of the invariant.
  - The lower bound `x >= 0` is also preserved because we started with a non-negative `x` and only increment it.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` will be equal to `100` (the first time the loop condition `x < 100` becomes false).

- **Validity of Invariant at Termination**: The invariant `x >= 0 && x <= 100` remains valid at termination since `100 >= 0` and `100 <= 100`.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: The provided post-condition `assert x == 100;` is correct.

- **Proof of Post-condition via Invariant**: At termination, the loop invariant `x >= 0 && x <= 100` is true, and since the loop condition `x < 100` is false, we conclude that `x` must be exactly `100`. Therefore, the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition implies the post-condition is met. Thus, the post-condition `x == 100` holds true.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
