2025-12-24 06:39:30,187 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo130` is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` as long as `x1` remains greater than zero and both `x2` and `x3` are also greater than zero. The intended outcome is to reduce these variables until either `x1` becomes non-positive or one of `x2` or `x3` becomes non-positive.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues executing as long as `x1 > 0`.
- **Operations in Loop Body:** Inside the loop, there are nested conditions that check if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`. If both conditions are true, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, respectively. In this case, `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are initialized to 1, so the decrement operation reduces each variable by 1.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values before the loop:
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = x2` (value passed to the function)
  - `x3 = x3` (value passed to the function)
  - `d1 = 1`, `d2 = 1`, `d3 = 1`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
Assuming `x2` and `x3` are both greater than 0:
1. After 1st iteration:
   - `x1 = 0`
   - `x2 = x2 - 1`
   - `x3 = x3 - 1`
   
2. After 2nd iteration:
   - Loop does not execute (as `x1` is no longer > 0).

3. After 3rd iteration:
   - Not applicable, loop has terminated.

4. After 4th iteration:
   - Not applicable, loop has terminated.

5. After 5th iteration:
   - Not applicable, loop has terminated.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0`, and either `x2` or `x3` may still be greater than or equal to 0.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The goal is to ensure that `x2 >= 0` upon termination of the loop.

**Can the Verification Goal be used as an Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal `x2 >= 0` is not guaranteed to hold true during each iteration of the loop. It is only guaranteed to be true at termination.

**Modification to Create a Valid Invariant:**
To create a valid invariant, we can modify the verification goal to:
- **Invariant:** `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0 && x1 >= 0`.

**Justification for Modified Invariant:**
- **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are initialized to positive values (assuming `x2` and `x3` are positive). Thus, the invariant holds before the first iteration.
- **Preservation:** If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, decrementing them will maintain `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`. If either `x2` or `x3` is zero, the loop will not execute further.
- **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x1 <= 0` implies that the loop condition `x1 > 0` is false. Since we only decrement `x2` and `x3` when they are positive, they must remain non-negative when the loop exits.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant is valid because:
- It holds true at the start of the loop (all initialized to 1).
- It is preserved during the loop's execution as `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented only if they are positive.
- It is true at termination, where `x1` becomes non-positive, but `x2` and `x3` are guaranteed to be non-negative due to the decrement conditions.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment of the Proposed Invariant:**
Before the first iteration of the loop, we have:
- `x1 = 1`, `x2 = x2` (initial value), `x3 = x3` (initial value).
Assuming `x2` and `x3` are initialized to positive values, `x1 >= 0`, `x2 >= 0`, and `x3 >= 0` holds true.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation of the Invariant:**
Assuming the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration:
- If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, the loop body executes and decrements all three variables.
- After decrementing:
  - `x1` becomes `x1 - 1` (still non-negative since it starts positive).
  - `x2` becomes `x2 - 1` (remains non-negative).
  - `x3` becomes `x3 - 1` (remains non-negative).
Thus, the invariant holds at the end of the iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables Upon Termination:**
When the loop terminates:
- `x1 <= 0`, which makes the loop condition false.
- `x2` and `x3` are either zero or positive.

**Validity of the Invariant at Termination:**
The invariant `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` will still hold because the decrement only happens while `x2` and `x3` are positive, ensuring they do not go below zero.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**
The post-condition states `assert x2 >= 0;`. This is correct.

**Explanation of How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
When the loop terminates, `x1` is no longer greater than zero, and since the loop invariant ensures that `x2` and `x3` are non-negative, the post-condition `x2 >= 0` is satisfied. The invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`), confirms that `x2` remains non-negative at termination.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-24 06:39:30,213 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo130(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

2025-12-24 06:53:34,660 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo130` is to decrement the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` while both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The loop continues until `x1` is no longer greater than 0, which implies that the loop is designed to run as long as there are iterations left (indicated by `x1`) and both `x2` and `x3` are positive.

**Structure:**  
- **Governing Condition:** The loop is governed by the condition `while(x1 > 0)`, which means it will continue executing as long as `x1` is greater than 0.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:** Inside the loop, there are nested conditions checking if `x2` and `x3` are greater than 0. If both conditions are true, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, respectively (all of which are initialized to 1).
- **Relevant Variables:** The variables relevant to the loop's behavior are `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`. Notably, `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are constant and equal to 1.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**  
- `x1 = 1`
- `x2 = x2` (initial value not specified)
- `x3 = x3` (initial value not specified)

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**  
   - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`:  
     - `x1 = 0`  
     - `x2 = x2 - 1`  
     - `x3 = x3 - 1`  
   - If either `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`:  
     - `x1 = 0`  
     - `x2 = x2`  
     - `x3 = x3`  

2. **After Iteration 2:**  
   - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`:  
     - `x1` will not be updated as the loop exits.  
   - If either `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`:  
     - `x1` will not be updated as the loop exits.  

3. **After Iteration 3:**  
   - Similar to above, `x1` remains 0, and the loop will not execute further.

4. **After Iteration 4:**  
   - Similar to above, `x1` remains 0.

5. **After Iteration 5:**  
   - Similar to above, `x1` remains 0.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**  
- Upon exiting the loop, `x1 = 0`, `x2` will be either `0` or its initial value decremented based on the number of iterations it went through, and `x3` will also be either `0` or decremented similarly.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**  
The verification goal is `assert x2 >= 0;`. This means we need to prove that at the end of the loop, `x2` is non-negative.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**  
- **NO:** The verification goal `x2 >= 0` can only be guaranteed at termination. During iterations, `x2` may still be greater than or equal to 0, but it is not guaranteed throughout the loop execution if `x2` was initially less than or equal to 0.

**Modification of Verification Goal:**  
We can modify the verification goal to create a suitable loop invariant:
- **Modified Invariant:** `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`. This modified invariant can be used because:
  - **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `x2` and `x3` are their initial values, which we assume are non-negative.
  - **Preservation:** If both `x2` and `x3` are positive, they will be decremented but remain non-negative.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, if `x1` is 0, it means the loop condition failed, but `x2` and `x3` must still be non-negative.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
`x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`.

**Explanation of Validity:**  
- This invariant is valid because it holds true at the beginning of the loop (assuming initial values are non-negative). It is preserved through each iteration, as `x2` and `x3` are only decremented when they are positive. If they are not positive, the loop does not execute further, ensuring they remain non-negative at termination.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment of the Proposed Invariant:**  
The invariant `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` is established before the loop begins. If we assume that the initial values of `x2` and `x3` are non-negative (which is necessary for the post-condition to hold), then the invariant holds true at the start.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation of the Invariant:**  
During each iteration of the loop:
- If both `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, they are decremented by 1, thus maintaining `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`.
- If either `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`, the loop does not execute further, and the invariant remains true.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**  
When the loop terminates, `x1` will be 0, and both `x2` and `x3` will be either decremented values or their initial values, but they will still satisfy the invariant `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`.

**Validity of Invariant on Termination:**  
The invariant remains valid upon termination because, by the time the loop condition `x1 > 0` becomes false, we have ensured that `x2` and `x3` cannot be negative.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**  
The provided post-condition `assert x2 >= 0;` is correct. 

**Explanation of How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**  
Since the loop invariant `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` holds true throughout the execution of the loop and is still valid when the loop terminates, we can conclude that `x2 >= 0` holds true when the loop exits. The loop condition being false (when `x1` is 0) ensures that the state of the variables at termination confirms the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-24 07:02:54,302 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The error messages indicate that the loop invariants `x2 >= \at(x2, Pre) - 1` and `x3 >= \at(x3, Pre) - 1` are not sufficient to ensure that `x2` and `x3` remain non-negative throughout the loop. Specifically, these invariants do not account for the possibility that `x2` and `x3` can become negative if they start with low values, especially since they are decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

Additionally, the assertion `assert x2 >= 0;` indicates that we need to ensure that `x2` is non-negative at the end of the loop, which is not guaranteed by the current invariants. Therefore, we need to regenerate the loop invariants to ensure that they hold true at the beginning and end of each iteration, as well as to imply the postcondition when the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo130(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

2025-12-24 07:07:15,368 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the provided C code snippet is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` while both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The loop continues executing as long as `x1` remains greater than zero. The intended outcome is to ensure that `x2` is non-negative by the time the loop terminates.

The structure of the loop is as follows:
- **Governing Condition**: `while(x1 > 0)` - The loop continues as long as `x1` is greater than zero.
- **Operations Performed**: Inside the loop, there are nested conditions that check if `x2` and `x3` are both greater than zero. If they are, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` respectively (all initialized to 1).
- **Relevant Variables**: 
  - `x1`: controls the number of iterations (decrements until it reaches 0).
  - `x2` and `x3`: are decremented if they are both positive, with the goal of ensuring `x2` is non-negative by the end of the loop.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = initial value (unknown)`
  - `x3 = initial value (unknown)`
  
- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **After Iteration 1**: 
    - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`: 
      - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = initial value - 1`, `x3 = initial value - 1`
  - **After Iteration 2**: 
    - Loop does not execute since `x1` is no longer greater than 0.
  - **After Iteration 3**: 
    - Not applicable, as the loop has terminated.
  - **After Iteration 4**: 
    - Not applicable, as the loop has terminated.
  - **After Iteration 5**: 
    - Not applicable, as the loop has terminated.
  
- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - If the loop terminates, `x1 = 0`, `x2 >= 0`, `x3` could be either positive or non-positive depending on the initial values.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition to prove is `assert x2 >= 0;`.
  
- **Can the Verification Goal Serve as Part of the Loop Invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true upon loop termination and not necessarily during the iterations.

- **Modification for Invariant**: 
  - A suitable invariant could be: `x2 >= 0` whenever `x1 > 0`.
  
  - **Establishment**: Initially, `x2` is some value, but as long as `x2` starts positive, it can be modified to ensure that `x2` does not go negative during iterations.
  
  - **Preservation**: If `x2` is positive before entering the loop and both conditions are satisfied, it will remain non-negative through each iteration.

  - **Termination**: When the loop exits, `x1` becomes 0, and since `x2` is decremented only when it is positive, it implies `x2 >= 0`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x2 >= 0 when x1 > 0`.

- **Validity Explanation**: This invariant is valid because:
  - It is established that if `x2` starts non-negative and the loop decrements `x2` only when both `x2` and `x3` are positive, `x2` will never become negative while the loop is executing.

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: 
  - Before the first iteration, if `x2` is initialized to a non-negative value, the invariant `x2 >= 0` holds true. The loop checks `x2 > 0` before decrementing, ensuring the invariant holds.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant**: 
  - If the invariant `x2 >= 0` holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `x1 > 0` is true, the loop body will only decrement `x2` if `x2` is positive. Therefore, `x2` remains non-negative at the end of the iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `x1 = 0`. The conditions `x2 >= 0` and `x3` can be either positive or negative but do not affect `x2` since it is checked before decrementing.

- **Invariant Validity at Termination**: 
  - At termination, since the loop condition fails (`x1 <= 0`), the invariant `x2 >= 0` must hold, thus fulfilling the requirement for the post-condition.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: 
  - The provided post-condition `assert x2 >= 0;` is correct.

- **Proof of Post-condition**: 
  - The invariant `x2 >= 0` holds true through the loop iterations and remains valid when the loop terminates. Thus, combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`), it confirms that `x2` must indeed be non-negative at the end of the loop execution.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo130(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

2025-12-24 07:12:24,780 - DEBUG  - regen reasoning
2025-12-24 07:12:24,780 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the loop invariant `x2 >= \at(x2, Pre) - 1;` is not preserved after each iteration and does not sufficiently imply the postcondition `assert x2 >= 0;`. The current invariant fails to account for the decrementing of `x2` properly, particularly since `x2` can be decremented multiple times based on the loop's conditions. 

To address these issues, we need to regenerate the loop invariant to ensure that:

1. **Establishment**: The invariant must hold true before the loop starts executing. We need to ensure that it can be established based on the initial values of `x2` and `x3`.
  
2. **Preservation**: The invariant must remain valid after each iteration. This means we need to account for the changes made to `x2` and ensure that the invariant still holds after potential decrements.

3. **Termination**: The invariant must imply the postcondition when the loop terminates. This means that when the loop condition is false, the invariant combined with that condition should ensure that `x2` is non-negative.

A suitable loop invariant would need to express that `x2` is non-negative throughout the loop and that it is constrained by its initial value and the maximum decrements that can occur.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo130(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;

2025-12-24 07:21:55,309 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the provided code snippet is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` as long as `x1` remains positive and both `x2` and `x3` are also positive. The intended outcome is to ensure that `x2` is non-negative by the time the loop terminates, which is enforced by the final assertion.

The loop structure consists of a `while` statement that governs the loop's execution based on the condition `x1 > 0`. Inside the loop, there are nested `if` statements that check whether `x2` and `x3` are both greater than zero. If both conditions are true, the loop decrements `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`, where all decrement values are initialized to 1.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x1 = 1`
- `x2 = <input_value>` (assumed to be some positive integer)
- `x3 = <input_value>` (assumed to be some positive integer)
- `d1 = 1`
- `d2 = 1`
- `d3 = 1`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, then:
     - `x1 = 0`
     - `x2 = <input_value> - 1`
     - `x3 = <input_value> - 1`
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - Loop condition `x1 > 0` is false, so the loop terminates.

Since `x1` is decremented to 0 after the first iteration, the loop will only execute once if `x2` and `x3` are both greater than 0.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The verification goal is to ensure that `x2 >= 0` after the loop terminates.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it only holds true at termination, not during iterations. During iterations, `x2` may be positive or may become negative if the loop continues to execute.

**Modification of Verification Goal:**
To create a suitable invariant, we can modify the verification goal to state that `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0` during the loop iterations. This implies that both `x2` and `x3` must remain non-negative as long as the loop is executing.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
The loop invariant can be stated as: 
- "At the start of each iteration, `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`."

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant is valid because:
1. **Establishment:** Initially, `x2` and `x3` are both positive integers (as per input), hence they are non-negative before the first iteration.
2. **Preservation:** If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, they are decremented by 1 in each iteration, thus remaining non-negative until one of them reaches 0. If either becomes 0, the loop terminates.
3. **Termination:** When the loop terminates, at least one of `x2` or `x3` will be 0, ensuring that the invariant holds true.

### e. Establishment

The proposed invariant is established because:
- Before the loop begins, the values of `x2` and `x3` are assumed to be positive integers (based on input), thus `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0` hold true.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved because:
- If the invariant holds true at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`), and both `x2` and `x3` are greater than 0, then after decrementing them by 1, they will still be non-negative. If either reaches 0, the loop condition will fail, leading to termination.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, the relevant variables are:
- `x1 = 0`
- `x2 = <input_value> - 1` (if `x2` was initially greater than 0)
- `x3 = <input_value> - 1` (if `x3` was initially greater than 0)

The invariant remains valid under these termination conditions because at least one of `x2` or `x3` will be non-negative when the loop exits.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `assert x2 >= 0;` is correct. The invariant ensures that as long as the loop runs, `x2` will not become negative. When the loop condition fails, it indicates that either `x1` has reached 0 or one of the conditions for decrementing has failed. Since we are guaranteed that `x2` and `x3` remain non-negative throughout the iterations, the assertion holds true.

Thus, the invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (which indicates that `x1` is no longer greater than 0), confirms that `x2` is indeed greater than or equal to 0 at termination.

2025-12-24 07:34:26,931 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo130` is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` while `x1` remains greater than zero. The intended outcome is to reduce `x2` to a non-negative value, given that `x2` and `x3` are both positive at the start. The loop's structure is governed by the condition `while(x1 > 0)`, meaning it will continue to execute as long as `x1` is positive.

Inside the loop, the following operations occur:
- The loop checks if `x2` is greater than zero.
- If `x2` is positive, it further checks if `x3` is also positive.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it decrements `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`. Given that `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are initialized to 1, this means that each variable will be decremented by 1.

Relevant variables for the loop's behavior include:
- `x1`: controls the number of iterations of the loop.
- `x2`: the variable that must remain non-negative.
- `x3`: a variable that must also be positive for the decrement operations to occur.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: Before the loop begins:
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = <initial value>` (assumed to be > 0)
  - `x3 = <initial value>` (assumed to be > 0)

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. **After 1st iteration**:
     - `x1 = 0`
     - `x2 = <initial value - 1>`
     - `x3 = <initial value - 1>`
  2. **After 2nd iteration**: (not applicable, as `x1` is now 0)
  3. **After 3rd iteration**: (not applicable)
  4. **After 4th iteration**: (not applicable)
  5. **After 5th iteration**: (not applicable)

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: The loop terminates immediately after the first iteration since `x1` becomes 0.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The provided post-condition is `assert x2 >= 0;`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true upon termination of the loop, not during its iterations.

- **Modification of the verification goal**: 
  - A suitable invariant could be `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0 && x1 >= 0` before each iteration. This modified invariant must satisfy:
    - **Establishment**: Before the first iteration, `x2`, `x3`, and `x1` are initialized to positive values, thus `x2 >= 0`, `x3 >= 0`, and `x1 >= 0` holds.
    - **Preservation**: If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, it remains true at the end of that iteration since `x2` and `x3` are decremented only when both are positive.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x1` will be 0, and since `x2` and `x3` are decremented only when they are positive, `x2` must still be non-negative.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0 && x1 >= 0`.

- **Explanation of Validity**: This invariant holds true at the beginning and end of every loop iteration because:
  - At the start of the loop, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are initialized to positive values.
  - During each iteration, `x2` and `x3` are decremented only if they are positive, ensuring they remain non-negative as long as the loop continues. 

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: 
  - Before the loop begins, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are initialized to 1 (or positive values). Thus, `x2 >= 0`, `x3 >= 0`, and `x1 >= 0` holds true before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant**: 
  - If `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0 && x1 >= 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration, the loop condition `while(x1 > 0)` ensures the loop will execute.
  - Inside the loop, `x1` is decremented by 1, and `x2` and `x3` are decremented only if they are both positive. Thus, if they are decremented, they remain non-negative.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables on Termination**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `x1` is 0. Since the loop only decrements `x2` and `x3` when they are positive, it follows that `x2` and `x3` are still non-negative when the loop exits.

- **Validity of the Invariant on Termination**: 
  - At termination, `x1` is 0, which does not invalidate the invariant since it does not contradict `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-condition**: 
  - The provided post-condition `assert x2 >= 0;` is correct.

- **Proof of Post-condition**: 
  - The invariant `x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0 && x1 >= 0` holds true at termination. When the loop condition is false (`x1 <= 0`), it implies that `x2` must still be non-negative due to the preservation of the invariant during the loop. Thus, the post-condition is satisfied.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo130(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###

- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
