#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop is to count the number of even and odd integers from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `i` counts the even integers, while `j` counts the odd integers. The loop iterates from `l = 0` to `l < n`, incrementing `l` on each iteration and updating `i` or `j` based on whether `l` is even or odd.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** `while (l < n)` - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than `n`.
- **Body Operations:**
  - If `l` is even (`l % 2 == 0`), increment `i`.
  - If `l` is odd, increment `j`.
  - Increment `l` by `1` after each iteration.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `i`: Counts even numbers.
  - `j`: Counts odd numbers.
  - `l`: The current number being evaluated, ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `i = 0`
- `j = 0`
- `l = 0`
- `n`: Given as input and must satisfy `n <= 20000001`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:** 
   - `l = 1` (0 was even)
   - `i = 1` (0 is even)
   - `j = 0`
   
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `l = 2` 
   - `i = 1` (1 is odd)
   - `j = 1` (1 is odd)

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `l = 3`
   - `i = 2` (2 is even)
   - `j = 1` (2 is even)

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `l = 4`
   - `i = 2` (3 is odd)
   - `j = 2` (3 is odd)

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `l = 5`
   - `i = 3` (4 is even)
   - `j = 2` (4 is even)

**Post-Loop Sampling (if applicable):**
- If `n = 5`, after the loop ends:
  - `l = 5` (loop condition false)
  - Final values: `i = 3`, `j = 2`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition is to assert that `i + j` is true, which implies that there are numbers counted.

**Can the Verification Goal be used as an Invariant?**
- **NO:** The goal `i + j` is only true after the loop terminates. It does not hold during iterations since `i` and `j` are being updated.

**Modification to Create a Valid Invariant:**
A valid loop invariant can be formulated as:
- "At the start of each iteration, `i + j = l`."
  
**Establishment:**
Before the loop starts, `l = 0`, thus `i + j = 0` (since both `i` and `j` are initialized to 0). This holds true.

**Preservation:**
During each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1. If `l` is even, `i` is incremented; if odd, `j` is incremented. Thus, `i + j` is always equal to `l` after the increment.

**Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `l = n`, and hence `i + j = n`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
"At the start of each iteration, `i + j = l`."

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant is valid because:
- It holds before the first iteration (`l = 0`, so `i + j = 0`).
- It is preserved through each iteration as shown in the preservation analysis.
- When the loop terminates (`l = n`), it implies that `i + j = n`, which supports the post-condition.

#### e. Establishment

**Establishment Explanation:**
The invariant `i + j = l` is established before the first iteration since both `i` and `j` are initialized to `0`, and `l` is also `0`. Thus, `0 + 0 = 0` holds true.

**Pre-condition Guarantee:**
The pre-condition `n <= 20000001` ensures that `l` will not exceed this value, making the loop's execution safe.

#### f. Preservation

**Preservation Explanation:**
If `i + j = l` holds at the start of an iteration:
- If `l` is even, `i` increments by 1, thus `i + j` becomes `l + 1` (since `l` increments by 1).
- If `l` is odd, `j` increments by 1, thus `i + j` becomes `l + 1`.
- Therefore, the invariant holds at the end of each iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `l = n`, and thus `i + j = n`. This means all integers from `0` to `n-1` have been counted.

**Validity of Invariant at Termination:**
The invariant remains valid because it confirms that all integers have been processed, aligning with the post-condition.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
The post-condition asserts `(i + j)`, which means there are numbers counted. 

**Correctness Explanation:**
Since the invariant states `i + j = n` upon termination, and the loop condition `l < n` is false, it follows that the post-condition is met, confirming the correctness of the loop's behavior.
