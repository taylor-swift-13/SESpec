#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo115` is to repeatedly increment two integer variables, `x` and `sn`, as long as the condition provided by the function `unknown()` evaluates to true. The intended outcome is that both `x` and `sn` will have the same final value when the loop terminates, given the assertion that if `sn` is not equal to -1, then `sn` must equal `x`.

The loop's structure is defined by the `while(unknown())` condition, which governs the loop's execution. The operations performed in the loop body are:
- `x = (x + 1);` which increments the variable `x` by 1.
- `sn = (sn + 1);` which increments the variable `sn` by 1.

The relevant variables are:
- `x`: Initialized to 0, it counts the number of iterations of the loop.
- `sn`: Also initialized to 0, it serves a similar purpose as `x`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x = 0`
  - `sn = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **After Iteration 1:**
    - `x = 1`
    - `sn = 1`
  - **After Iteration 2:**
    - `x = 2`
    - `sn = 2`
  - **After Iteration 3:**
    - `x = 3`
    - `sn = 3`
  - **After Iteration 4:**
    - `x = 4`
    - `sn = 4`
  - **After Iteration 5:**
    - `x = 5`
    - `sn = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling (if applicable):**
  - If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, we would have `x = 5` and `sn = 5` when the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal is given by the assertion:
- `assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);`

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only true at termination and does not hold during each iteration of the loop.

- **Can the verification goal be modified to create a valid invariant?**
  - We can modify the verification goal to state that:
    - "At the start of each iteration, `sn == x`."
  
  - **Establishment:** Initially, before the loop starts, both `sn` and `x` are 0, thus `sn == x` holds true.
  
  - **Preservation:** If `sn == x` holds at the start of an iteration, after incrementing both `sn` and `x`, they will still be equal, thus `sn == x` will hold true at the end of the iteration.
  
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` is false, and since `sn == x` holds true at the end of the last iteration, it implies that the post-condition is satisfied.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

A valid loop invariant for this loop can be proposed as:
- **Invariant:** `sn == x`

- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - This invariant is true at the beginning of the loop (both are initialized to 0).
  - It is preserved through each iteration (both `sn` and `x` are incremented together).
  - It holds true at termination, thereby supporting the assertion that if `sn != -1`, then `sn == x`.

#### e. Establishment

The proposed invariant `sn == x` is established as follows:
- Before the loop starts, both `sn` and `x` are initialized to 0. Therefore, the invariant `sn == x` holds true.

#### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved as follows:
- Assume that at the start of an iteration, `sn == x`. After executing the loop body, both `sn` and `x` are incremented by 1:
  - New value of `x` = Old value of `x` + 1
  - New value of `sn` = Old value of `sn` + 1
- Since both variables are incremented equally, the invariant `sn == x` remains true at the end of the iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates:
- The condition `unknown()` becomes false. At this point, the last values of `sn` and `x` are equal due to the invariant holding throughout the loop.
- Thus, the invariant `sn == x` remains valid at termination.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition:
- `assert (sn != -1) ==> (sn == x);` is correct.

- **Explanation:**
  - The invariant `sn == x` guarantees that when the loop exits, both `sn` and `x` have the same value. If `sn` is not equal to -1, then by the invariant, it must also be true that `x` is equal to `sn`. Thus, the post-condition is satisfied, proving correctness.
