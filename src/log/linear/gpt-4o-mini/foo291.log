2025-12-24 06:37:43,343 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo291` is to modify the values of the variables `x` and `y` until `x` is no longer less than `y`. The intended outcome is to ensure that, upon termination of the loop, the value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues executing as long as `x < y`.
- **Operations Performed:**
  - If `x` is negative, it is incremented by 7. Otherwise, it is incremented by 10.
  - If `y` is negative, it is decremented by 10. Otherwise, it is incremented by 3.
  
**Relevant Variables:**
- `x`: An integer that is modified based on its value (negative or non-negative).
- `y`: An integer that is modified based on its value (negative or non-negative).

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Let’s assume initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 10`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - `x` becomes `10` (since it was `0`, and `0 + 10 = 10`).
   - `y` becomes `13` (since it was `10`, and `10 + 3 = 13`).
   
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `x` becomes `20` (since it was `10`, and `10 + 10 = 20`).
   - `y` becomes `16` (since it was `13`, and `13 + 3 = 16`).
   
3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `x` becomes `30` (since it was `20`, and `20 + 10 = 30`).
   - `y` becomes `19` (since it was `16`, and `16 + 3 = 19`).
   
4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `x` becomes `40` (since it was `30`, and `30 + 10 = 40`).
   - `y` becomes `22` (since it was `19`, and `19 + 3 = 22`).
   
5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `x` becomes `50` (since it was `40`, and `40 + 10 = 50`).
   - `y` becomes `25` (since it was `22`, and `22 + 3 = 25`).

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If we continue this process, we see that `x` continues to increase while `y` also increases but at a slower rate. The loop will eventually terminate when `x` is no longer less than `y`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition is `assert x >= y;`. 

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as Part of the Loop Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true upon termination of the loop, not during iterations.

**Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
To create a suitable invariant, we can modify it to:
- **Invariant:** `x >= y - 3 * (number of iterations)`.
This modification accounts for the changes in `y` due to the loop's operations.

**Establishment:**
- Before the first iteration, if `x < y`, we know `x` is less than `y` but will be incremented more significantly than `y` in subsequent iterations.

**Preservation:**
- Each iteration alters `x` and `y`, but `x` is incremented by either 7 or 10, while `y` is incremented by 3 or decremented by 10, maintaining the invariant.

**Termination:**
- When the loop condition `x < y` is false, the invariant implies `x >= y`, thus satisfying the post-condition.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- At the start of each iteration, `x >= y - 3 * (number of iterations)`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant is valid because:
  - It accounts for the relative rates of change of `x` and `y`.
  - It is established before the loop starts and is preserved through each iteration.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
- The pre-condition `x < y && y <= 20000001` ensures that initially, `x` is less than `y`, allowing for the first iteration to start with `x` incrementing more than `y` in subsequent iterations.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, the operations ensure that:
  - `x` is incremented by 7 or 10.
  - `y` is either decremented by 10 or incremented by 3.
- This guarantees that the invariant holds true after the iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Relevant Variables on Termination:**
- When the loop terminates, `x` is no longer less than `y`. Thus, the invariant `x >= y - 3 * (number of iterations)` will also hold true.

**Validity of the Invariant Under Termination:**
- At termination, since `x >= y` holds, the invariant is still valid.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `assert x >= y;` is correct.

**How the Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition Proves the Post-condition:**
- When the loop condition `x < y` is false, it implies `x >= y`, which directly satisfies the post-condition. Thus, the invariant supports the correctness of the post-condition.

2025-12-24 06:37:43,367 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) < \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 20000001 && (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(x,Pre))`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires x < y && y <= 20000001;
    */
    
void foo291(int x, int y) {
