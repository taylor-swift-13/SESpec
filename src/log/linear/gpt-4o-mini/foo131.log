2025-12-24 01:11:14,770 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo131` is to decrement the variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` as long as `x1` remains positive and both `x2` and `x3` are also positive. The intended outcome is to reduce `x2` and `x3` to zero or below while ensuring that `x1` counts down, thereby controlling the number of iterations based on the values of `x2` and `x3`.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues as long as `x1 > 0`.
- **Operations Performed in the Body:**
  - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, then:
    - `x1` is decremented by `d1` (which is initialized to 1).
    - `x2` is decremented by `d2` (also initialized to 1).
    - `x3` is decremented by `d3` (also initialized to 1).
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x1`: Controls the number of iterations; initialized to 1.
  - `x2`: A parameter that influences the loop; decremented in the loop.
  - `x3`: Another parameter that influences the loop; decremented in the loop.
  - `d1`, `d2`, `d3`: Constants (all initialized to 1) that determine how much `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented in each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop starts:
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = <initial value>` (unknown)
  - `x3 = <initial value>` (unknown)

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
- **After Iteration 1:**
  - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, then:
    - `x1 = 0`
    - `x2 = x2 - 1`
    - `x3 = x3 - 1`
- **After Iteration 2:** (not executed since `x1` is now 0)
- **After Iteration 3:** (not executed)
- **After Iteration 4:** (not executed)
- **After Iteration 5:** (not executed)

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- After exiting the loop:
  - `x1 = 0`
  - `x2 = <final value>` (either unchanged if `x2 <= 0` before entering the loop or decremented by 1 if `x2 > 0`)
  - `x3 = <final value>` (similarly for `x3`)

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The verification goal is to prove that `x3 >= 0` at the end of the function.

**Can the Verification Goal be used as part of the Loop Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal (`x3 >= 0`) is only guaranteed to be true at termination and not necessarily during each iteration. During iterations, `x3` can be decremented, making it potentially negative.

**Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
A suitable loop invariant could be:
- **Invariant:** `x3 >= <initial value> - (iterations completed)`

This modified invariant will hold true:
- **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `x3 >= <initial value> - 0`, which is true.
- **Preservation:** If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, and we decrement `x3` by 1, then it still holds as long as `x3 > 0`.
- **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `x1` is 0, and if `x3` was decremented `n` times, then `x3` will be greater than or equal to `0` if `n` does not exceed the initial value of `x3`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`x3 >= <initial value> - (initial value of x1 - current value of x1)`

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant holds true:
- At the start of the loop, `x3` is at its initial value and `x1` has not been decremented yet.
- At the end of each iteration, if `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, `x3` is decremented, but the invariant will still hold since we track how many times `x1` has decremented, and thus we can adjust our understanding of `x3` in relation to its initial value.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment of the Invariant:**
The invariant is established because at the beginning of the loop:
- `x3` is at its initial value, and since `x1` starts at 1, the invariant holds as `x3 >= initial_value - (1 - 1)` which simplifies to `x3 >= initial_value`, which is true.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation of the Invariant:**
If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `x3 >= <initial value> - (initial value of x1 - current value of x1)`), and the loop condition (`x1 > 0`) is true, then:
- If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, `x3` is decremented by 1. The current value of `x1` will also be decremented.
- The new invariant condition will be `x3 >= <initial value> - (initial value of x1 - (current value of x1 - 1))`, which remains true.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `x1` will be `0`. The state of `x3` depends on how many iterations were completed. If `x3` was decremented `n` times, then:
- `x3` will be `initial value - n`, where `n` is the number of iterations, which cannot exceed the initial value of `x3` if `x2` and `x3` were initially positive.

**Validity of the Invariant on Termination:**
At termination, since the loop condition is false (`x1 <= 0`), the invariant still holds because we can deduce that `x3 >= 0` if `n` does not exceed its initial value.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Post-condition:**
The post-condition states `assert x3 >= 0;`. This is correct if the loop invariant is valid and the loop has correctly decremented `x3` without going below zero.

**Proving the Post-condition:**
The invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`), ensures that the number of iterations cannot exceed the initial value of `x3`. Thus, when the loop terminates, `x3` must be greater than or equal to zero, fulfilling the post-condition.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-24 01:11:14,797 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo131(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

2025-12-24 01:21:49,209 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo131` is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` as long as `x1` remains positive and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The intended outcome is to reduce `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` to non-negative values while ensuring that `x3` is at least 0 by the time the loop terminates.

The loop's structure consists of a `while` loop that checks the condition `x1 > 0`. Within the loop body, there are nested `if` statements that check whether `x2` and `x3` are both greater than 0. If both conditions are satisfied, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, respectively, which are all initialized to 1.

Relevant variables:
- `x1`: controls the loop's execution; decremented each iteration.
- `x2`: decremented if both `x2` and `x3` are positive.
- `x3`: decremented if both `x2` and `x3` are positive.
- `d1`, `d2`, `d3`: constants set to 1, used for decrementing `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = initial value (assumed > 0 for analysis)`
  - `x3 = initial value (assumed > 0 for analysis)`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. **After Iteration 1**:
     - `x1 = 0` (decremented by 1)
     - `x2 = initial value - 1` (if `x2 > 0`)
     - `x3 = initial value - 1` (if `x3 > 0`)
  2. **After Iteration 2**: Loop will not execute as `x1` is now 0.
  3. **After Iteration 3**: N/A
  4. **After Iteration 4**: N/A
  5. **After Iteration 5**: N/A

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - `x1 = 0`
  - `x2 = initial value - 1` (if `x2 > 0`)
  - `x3 = initial value - 1` (if `x3 > 0`)

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: `assert x3 >= 0;`

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it may not hold true during all iterations. It only needs to be true upon termination.

- **Modification of Verification Goal**: 
  - A suitable invariant could be: "If `x1 > 0`, then `x3 >= 0`". This would imply that while the loop is running, `x3` is non-negative if the loop condition is satisfied.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: "While `x1 > 0`, it holds that `x3 >= 0`."

- **Explanation of Validity**:
  - This invariant is valid because it asserts that as long as `x1` is positive (and thus the loop continues), `x3` must remain non-negative. This is maintained through the loop's structure since `x3` is only decremented if `x2` is also positive, which we can assume will not cause `x3` to drop below 0 unless `x3` starts at a low value.

### e. Establishment

- **How the proposed invariant is established**:
  - Before the first iteration, if both `x2` and `x3` are initialized to positive values, then `x3 >= 0` holds true.

- **Pre-condition guarantee**:
  - The pre-condition that `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0` ensures that `x3` starts off non-negative, satisfying the invariant before the loop begins.

### f. Preservation

- **How the invariant is preserved**:
  - If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (`x3 >= 0`), and if `x2 > 0`, then `x3` is decremented by 1 (but will still remain non-negative as long as it was initially greater than 0). Thus, if `x3` starts non-negative, it will remain so as long as the loop continues.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of variables upon termination**:
  - When the loop terminates, `x1` will be 0. The values of `x2` and `x3` will depend on how many times the decrement operation was executed but will still satisfy `x3 >= 0` as long as `x3` started non-negative and `x2` was positive enough to allow at least one iteration.

- **Validity of the invariant under termination**:
  - The invariant remains valid upon termination since `x1` being 0 implies the loop condition is false, and thus the assertion `x3 >= 0` holds true if it was maintained during iterations.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the post-condition**:
  - The post-condition `assert x3 >= 0;` is correct based on the established loop invariant and the logic of the loop.

- **How the invariant and negation of the loop condition prove the post-condition**:
  - When the loop condition `x1 > 0` is false, we know that the loop has terminated. Given that the invariant held throughout the loop iterations, it guarantees that `x3` remains non-negative at the point of termination, thus satisfying the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo131(int x2,int x3) {

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###

- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.

2025-12-24 01:34:47,872 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo131` is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` as long as `x1` is greater than zero, and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The intended outcome is to ensure that `x3` is non-negative by the time the loop terminates.

The loop's governing condition is `while(x1 > 0)`, which means the loop will continue executing as long as `x1` remains positive. Inside the loop, there are nested conditions that check if `x2` and `x3` are both greater than zero. If they are, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented by `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, respectively, which are all initialized to 1.

The relevant variables are:
- `x1`: Controls the number of iterations; it starts at 1 and decreases with each iteration.
- `x2` and `x3`: Their values dictate whether the decrements will occur; they are checked to ensure they are positive before any decrements.
- `d1`, `d2`, `d3`: Constants that determine how much to decrement `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` (all set to 1).

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = initial_value_of_x2` (assumed > 0 for the loop to execute)
  - `x3 = initial_value_of_x3` (assumed > 0 for the loop to execute)

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **After Iteration 1**:
    - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`: 
      - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = initial_value_of_x2 - 1`, `x3 = initial_value_of_x3 - 1`
  - **After Iteration 2**: Not applicable as `x1` would be 0 after the first iteration.
  - **After Iteration 3**: Not applicable.
  - **After Iteration 4**: Not applicable.
  - **After Iteration 5**: Not applicable.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - The loop terminates after the first iteration if both `x2` and `x3` are positive.
  - Final state: `x1 = 0`, `x2 = initial_value_of_x2 - 1`, `x3 = initial_value_of_x3 - 1`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal is the post-condition `assert x3 >= 0;`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?** 
  - **NO**: The post-condition `x3 >= 0` can only be guaranteed after the loop terminates, not during its iterations. During iterations, `x3` may still be positive but not guaranteed to be non-negative until the loop ends.

- **Modification of the verification goal**:
  - A suitable invariant could be: `x3 >= initial_value_of_x3 - (1 - x1)`, which reflects that `x3` is decremented only when `x1` is positive and both `x2` and `x3` are greater than zero.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x3 >= initial_value_of_x3 - (1 - x1)`

**Explanation**: 
- This invariant is valid because it asserts that the value of `x3` is always greater than or equal to its initial value minus the number of decrements applied to it. Since `x1` starts at 1 and decrements by 1 each time the loop iterates, this invariant holds true throughout the iterations.

### e. Establishment

The proposed invariant holds true before the first iteration because:
- Initially, `x1 = 1`, which means no decrements have occurred yet. Therefore, `x3 >= initial_value_of_x3 - (1 - 1)` simplifies to `x3 >= initial_value_of_x3`, which is true if `x3` is initially positive.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved because:
- If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration and `x1 > 0`, and both `x2` and `x3` are greater than zero, then the loop body executes and decrements `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by 1.
- After the iteration, `x1` becomes `x1 - 1`, and `x3` becomes `x3 - 1`. The invariant then updates to reflect this change, ensuring it still holds.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates:
- `x1` will be 0, and if the loop condition was true, both `x2` and `x3` would have been decremented accordingly.
- The invariant remains valid because it reflects that `x3` has been decremented appropriately based on the initial values and how many iterations occurred.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `assert x3 >= 0;` is correct if the loop terminates under the condition that `x2` and `x3` were both positive initially. 

- The invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition (`x1 <= 0`) implies that `x3` must be at least as large as its initial value minus the decrements applied. If `x3` was initially greater than or equal to 0 and only decremented when `x1` was positive, then it must hold that `x3 >= 0` at termination. Thus, the post-condition is satisfied.

2025-12-24 01:34:47,899 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

Loop program: `

    int d1 = 1;
    int d2 = 1;
    int d3 = 1;
    int x1 = 1;

2025-12-24 01:47:27,277 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the `foo131` function is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` while `x1` remains positive. The intended outcome is to ensure that the values of `x2` and `x3` are decremented as long as `x1` is greater than zero and both `x2` and `x3` are positive. The loop effectively continues to execute until `x1` is no longer greater than zero.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues as long as `x1 > 0`.
- **Operations Performed in the Body:**
  - The loop contains a nested conditional that checks if both `x2` and `x3` are greater than zero. If both conditions are true, it decrements `x1` by `d1`, `x2` by `d2`, and `x3` by `d3`.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x1`: The loop counter that determines how many iterations will occur. It starts at 1 and decrements.
  - `x2`, `x3`: These variables are decremented if both are positive. They control whether the loop body executes.
  - `d1`, `d2`, `d3`: Decrement values initialized to 1, which are used to decrement `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` respectively.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values:
  - `x1 = 1`
  - `x2 = <initial_value>` (not specified)
  - `x3 = <initial_value>` (not specified)
  - `d1 = 1`, `d2 = 1`, `d3 = 1`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`: 
     - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = <initial_value> - 1`, `x3 = <initial_value> - 1`
   - If either `x2 <= 0` or `x3 <= 0`: 
     - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = <initial_value>`, `x3 = <initial_value>`

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - The loop does not execute as `x1` is now 0.

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - Same as above.

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - Same as above.

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - Same as above.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- Final values upon exiting the loop:
  - `x1 = 0`
  - `x2 = <final_value>` (depends on initial values and decrements)
  - `x3 = <final_value>` (depends on initial values and decrements)

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The verification goal is the assertion `assert x3 >= 0;`. This means we need to ensure that when the loop terminates, `x3` is non-negative.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it only needs to be true at termination, not during the iterations of the loop.

**Modification of the Verification Goal:**
To create a valid invariant, we can modify it to state that:
- **Invariant:** `x3 >= 0` at the start of each iteration, given that `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`.

**Establishment:**
- Initially, we assume `x2` and `x3` are both positive before entering the loop, ensuring `x3 >= 0` holds true at the start.

**Preservation:**
- If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, both will be decremented by 1, thus maintaining `x3 >= 0` as long as it starts positive.

**Termination:**
- When the loop exits, `x1` will be 0, and if `x2` and `x3` were both positive during the loop, `x3` will remain non-negative.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`x3 >= 0` when the loop condition `x1 > 0` is true.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant is valid because it holds true at the beginning of the loop (establishment) and is maintained throughout the iterations (preservation). When the loop condition fails, we can conclude that `x3` is still non-negative.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
- Before the first iteration, if we assume `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, it guarantees that `x3` is indeed non-negative. Thus, the invariant `x3 >= 0` holds before the loop begins.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
- At the start of each iteration, if `x3 >= 0` holds and both `x2` and `x3` are greater than zero, they are decremented by 1. Thus, `x3` remains non-negative after the iteration completes as long as it started positive.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables at Termination:**
- When the loop terminates, `x1` is 0. If `x2` and `x3` were both positive during the last iteration, they would be decremented to at least 0, hence `x3` remains non-negative.

**Validity of Invariant at Termination:**
- The invariant `x3 >= 0` is still valid upon termination since the loop exits only when `x1` is no longer greater than 0.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Post-condition:**
- The provided post-condition `assert x3 >= 0;` is correct.

**How the Invariant and Negation of the Loop Condition Proves the Post-condition:**
- When the loop condition `x1 > 0` is false, we have established that `x3 >= 0` holds true based on the invariant. Thus, the post-condition is satisfied upon loop termination.

2025-12-24 01:47:27,305 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x1 == 1) * (d3 == 1) * (d2 == 1) * (d1 == 1) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre))`

2025-12-24 01:59:21,727 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo131` is to decrement the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` while `x1` remains positive. The intended outcome is to ensure that `x3` is non-negative by the time the loop terminates.

The loop's governing condition is `while(x1 > 0)`, which means the loop will continue executing as long as `x1` is greater than zero. Inside the loop, there is a nested condition that checks if both `x2` and `x3` are greater than zero. If both conditions are true, the following operations are performed:
- `x1` is decremented by `d1` (which is initialized to 1).
- `x2` is decremented by `d2` (also initialized to 1).
- `x3` is decremented by `d3` (again initialized to 1).

The relevant variables affecting the loop's behavior are:
- `x1`: the primary loop counter that determines how many iterations the loop will execute.
- `x2` and `x3`: conditions that must be satisfied for the decrement operations to occur.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x1 = 1`
- `x2 = <initial value>` (assumed positive)
- `x3 = <initial value>` (assumed positive)

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`: 
     - `x1 = 0`, `x2 = <initial value> - 1`, `x3 = <initial value> - 1`
2. **After Iteration 2:** (not executed since `x1` is now 0)
   - Not applicable.
3. **After Iteration 3:** (not executed)
   - Not applicable.
4. **After Iteration 4:** (not executed)
   - Not applicable.
5. **After Iteration 5:** (not executed)
   - Not applicable.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- Upon exiting the loop, since `x1` is now 0, the loop condition `x1 > 0` is false.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal is the post-condition `assert x3 >= 0;`.

- **Can this goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The goal `x3 >= 0` is only guaranteed to be true upon termination of the loop, not during the iterations.

- **Modification to create a valid invariant:**
  - We can modify the verification goal to state that `x3 >= 0` holds at the end of each iteration if the loop is executed. 

**Proposed modified invariant:** `x3 >= 0 at the end of each iteration while x1 > 0.`

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:** `x3 >= 0`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant states that `x3` must remain non-negative during each iteration of the loop. If `x2 > 0` and `x3 > 0`, `x3` is decremented by 1, but it will not go below 0 because the loop condition guarantees that the loop stops before `x3` can be decremented further if it would become negative.

### e. Establishment

The invariant `x3 >= 0` is established before the loop begins because it is assumed that `x3` starts with a positive value. Since the loop only decrements `x3` when both `x2` and `x3` are positive, the initial condition guarantees that `x3` will not be negative at the start.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved because:
- At the beginning of an iteration, if `x3 >= 0` holds and the loop condition `x1 > 0` is true, the loop body will only decrement `x3` if both `x2` and `x3` are greater than 0.
- If both are true, `x3` is decremented by 1, but since it started at a positive value, it will remain non-negative after the decrement.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, `x1` is no longer greater than 0, which means `x1` has reached 0. At this point, `x3` could be either equal to 0 or greater than 0 depending on how many iterations occurred. Thus, the invariant `x3 >= 0` remains valid upon termination.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `assert x3 >= 0;` is correct. 

- The invariant `x3 >= 0`, combined with the fact that the loop condition `x1 > 0` is false at termination, implies that `x3` must be non-negative when the loop exits. Thus, the post-condition is satisfied, confirming that `x3` is indeed greater than or equal to 0 when the function completes.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.
