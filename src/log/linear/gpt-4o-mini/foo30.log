#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the `foo30` function is to decrement the value of `x` from its initial value of 100 down to 0. The intended outcome is to ensure that after the loop has completed, the variable `x` will equal 0.

The loop's structure consists of a `while` loop that continues as long as `x` is greater than 0 (`while (x > 0)`). Inside the loop body, the operation performed is `x = x - 1`, which decrements the value of `x` by 1 on each iteration. The relevant variable in this context is `x`, which is initialized to 100 before the loop starts.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - Before the loop begins, `x = 100`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After iteration 1: `x = 99`
  - After iteration 2: `x = 98`
  - After iteration 3: `x = 97`
  - After iteration 4: `x = 96`
  - After iteration 5: `x = 95`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - The loop will continue until `x` reaches 0. Upon termination, the final value of `x` will be `0`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The goal is to prove that `x == 0` after the loop terminates.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal `x == 0` is only true at termination, not during iterations of the loop. During iterations, `x` will be greater than 0 until the last iteration.

- **Modification for a valid invariant**:
  - A valid invariant could be `x >= 0`. This modified invariant can be analyzed as follows:
    - **Establishment**: Before the first iteration, `x = 100`, which satisfies `x >= 0`.
    - **Preservation**: If `x >= 0` holds at the start of an iteration and `x > 0` (the loop condition), after executing `x = x - 1`, we have `x` decremented by 1, hence `x` will still be `>= 0`.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` is 0 (the last value before the loop condition fails), which satisfies the condition `x >= 0`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: The invariant is that `x >= 0`.

- **Validity of the Invariant**: 
  - This invariant is valid because it holds true at the beginning of the loop (when `x` is initialized to 100) and remains true at the end of each iteration (as `x` is decremented but never goes below 0). 

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: 
  - The invariant `x >= 0` is established because before the first iteration, `x` is initialized to 100, which is greater than 0.

- **Pre-condition Guarantee**: 
  - The pre-condition guarantees that `x` starts at 100, thus ensuring that `x >= 0` holds before the first iteration.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant**: 
  - If `x >= 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration and the loop condition `x > 0` is true, then after executing `x = x - 1`, `x` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, `x` will still be greater than or equal to 0, thus preserving the invariant.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `x` is equal to 0 (the loop condition `x > 0` becomes false when `x` is decremented from 1 to 0).

- **Validity of the Invariant at Termination**: 
  - The invariant `x >= 0` remains valid at termination since `x` is exactly 0, which satisfies the invariant.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-condition**: 
  - The provided post-condition `assert x == 0;` is correct.

- **Proof of Post-condition**: 
  - The invariant `x >= 0`, combined with the negation of the loop condition (which is `x <= 0` when the loop terminates), implies that when the loop exits, `x` must be exactly 0. Thus, the post-condition is met.
