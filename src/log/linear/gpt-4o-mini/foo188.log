2025-12-24 02:36:29,344 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo188` is to perform a series of operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the condition provided by the `unknown()` function. The intended outcome is to manipulate these variables in a way that is dependent on their current values and the results of the `unknown()` function, which dictates how many times the loop will execute.

The loop's governing condition is `while(unknown())`, meaning that it will continue executing as long as `unknown()` returns a true value. Inside the loop, the following operations occur:

1. If `x` is greater than or equal to 4, then `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 2.
2. If `y` is greater than `10 * w` and `z` is greater than or equal to `100 * x`, then `y` is negated.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 100.
4. After these conditional checks, `w` is incremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 10.

The relevant variables affecting the loop's behavior are `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, which are all initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values before the loop:
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
- **After Iteration 1:**
  - If `unknown()` is true and the first condition (`x >= 4`) is false, then:
    - `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`
  
- **After Iteration 2:**
  - If the loop condition holds and `x` is still less than 4:
    - `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`
  
- **After Iteration 3:**
  - Continuing the same path:
    - `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`
  
- **After Iteration 4:**
  - Continuing the same path:
    - `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`
  
- **After Iteration 5:**
  - If the loop continues:
    - `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If `unknown()` eventually returns false, the final values could be:
  - `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal is the assertion `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`. This means if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because it is only relevant at termination, not during the iterations. The values of `y` and `x` can change significantly during the loop, especially since `y` is often increased by 100.

- **Modification of the verification goal:**
  - We need to establish an invariant that relates `x` and `y` during iterations. A potential invariant could be:
    - `y >= 0` and `x <= 4`.
  
This invariant can be modified to ensure that it holds true throughout the iterations:
- **Establishment:** At the start, `x = 0` and `y = 0`, so `y >= 0` and `x <= 4` holds.
- **Preservation:** We need to show that if `y >= 0` and `x <= 4` holds at the start of an iteration, it remains true after the iteration.
- **Termination:** When the loop terminates, the invariant must still hold, and we need to ensure it leads to the post-condition.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

A proposed loop invariant is:
- `y >= 0` and `x <= 4`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant is valid because:
  - Initially, both conditions hold true (`x = 0` and `y = 0`).
  - The operations in the loop either keep `y` non-negative (by adding to it) or change `x` but do not allow it to exceed 4 until the condition allows it.
  - The loop will eventually terminate when `unknown()` returns false, and if `y` remains less than or equal to 2, `x` will also remain less than 4.

### e. Establishment

The proposed invariant `y >= 0` and `x <= 4` is established because:
- Before the loop starts, all variables are initialized to 0. Therefore, `y >= 0` and `x <= 4` holds true.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved as follows:
- During each iteration:
  - If `x >= 4`, it is incremented by 1, which violates `x <= 4`, thus indicating the loop should not enter this state if the invariant holds.
  - If `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`, `y` is negated, but since `y` starts from 0 and is always incremented, it will not violate `y >= 0`.
  - The else clause increments `x` and `y` but keeps `x` in check until the condition fails.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` is false. The relevant states of the variables could be:
- `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

The invariant remains valid under these termination conditions because:
- The invariant states `y >= 0` and `x <= 4`, which might not hold at termination but is not required since the post-condition is only concerned with the case where `y <= 2`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` is correct under the following conditions:
- If `y` is less than or equal to 2, then the invariant `x < 4` must hold because the operations in the loop ensure that `y` is significantly incremented, preventing it from being less than or equal to 2 if `x` were to reach 4 or more.

Thus, the invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition, confirms that the post-condition is met when the loop terminates.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;
    w = 0;

2025-12-24 02:36:29,372 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo188() {

    int x;

2025-12-24 02:37:12,796 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (line 16)**  
   - The invariant `y >= 0` fails preservation because the operations within the loop can potentially set `y` to a negative value, especially when `y` is negated in the second conditional (`y = 0 - y;`). This means that `y` can be negative after the iteration, violating the invariant.

2. **Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (line 19)**  
   - The invariant `x <= 4` also fails preservation. The loop allows `x` to be incremented without any upper limit when `x >= 4`, which means that `x` can exceed 4 during iterations. Thus, this invariant is not maintained after the loop body executes.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion (line 38)**  
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4. The invariants need to be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be derived from them when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

2025-12-24 02:39:29,389 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**  
   The invariant `y <= 2 * (4 - x)` fails preservation because the operations within the loop can cause `y` to exceed this bound. Specifically, when `x` is incremented, `y` can be increased by 100 in the else branch, which could lead to `y` being greater than `2 * (4 - x)` if `x` is small. This means the invariant does not hold after certain iterations.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion**  
   The assertion `/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4. The relationship between `y` and `x` needs to be strengthened to ensure that the assertion can be derived from the invariants when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

To address these issues, we need to regenerate the loop invariants to ensure they are both strong enough to support the assertion and preserved through each iteration of the loop.

2025-12-24 02:43:02,254 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**  
   The invariant `y <= 100 * (3 - x)` fails preservation because during the loop execution, `y` can be incremented significantly (by 100 in the else clause) when `x` is less than 4. This means that if `x` is 3, `y` can exceed the invariant limit when it is incremented, thus violating the invariant after certain iterations.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion**  
   The assertion `/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4. The relationship between `y` and `x` needs to be strengthened to ensure that the assertion can be derived from the invariants when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

To address these issues, we need to regenerate the loop invariants to ensure they are both strong enough to support the assertion and preserved through each iteration of the loop.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo188` is to perform a series of updates on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the condition provided by the function `unknown()`. The loop continues executing as long as `unknown()` returns true. 

The loop's structure can be broken down as follows:
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues while `unknown()` is true.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:**
  - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, set `y` to `-y` (negate `y`).
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  - Regardless of the previous conditions, increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10 at the end of each iteration.
  
The relevant variables are:
- `x`: Starts at 0 and can increase based on the conditions.
- `y`: Starts at 0 and can be modified based on conditions related to `x`, `w`, and `z`.
- `z`: Starts at 0 and increases by 10 each iteration.
- `w`: Starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  1. **After Iteration 1:**
     - `unknown()` is true, enter loop.
     - `x < 4`, so `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `w = 1`, `z = 10`.
  2. **After Iteration 2:**
     - `unknown()` is true, enter loop.
     - `y > 10 * w` (100 > 10) and `z >= 100 * x` (10 >= 100), so `y = -100`, `x = 2`, `w = 2`, `z = 20`.
  3. **After Iteration 3:**
     - `unknown()` is true, enter loop.
     - `y <= 10 * w` (-100 <= 20) and `z < 100 * x` (20 < 200), so `x = 3`, `y = 0`, `w = 3`, `z = 30`.
  4. **After Iteration 4:**
     - `unknown()` is true, enter loop.
     - `x < 4`, so `x = 4`, `y = 100`, `w = 4`, `z = 40`.
  5. **After Iteration 5:**
     - `unknown()` is true, enter loop.
     - `x >= 4`, so `x = 5`, `y = 102`, `w = 5`, `z = 50`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - If `unknown()` becomes false after the fifth iteration, assume final values could be `x = 5`, `y = 102`, `w = 5`, `z = 50`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The assertion `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` needs to be proven.
  
- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal is only true at termination, not during iterations. The condition `(y <= 2)` is not guaranteed to hold during the loop.

- **Modification of Verification Goal:**
  - A potential modified invariant could be: `y <= 100 * w` and `x < 5`.
  - This invariant can be shown to hold:
    - **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `y = 0`, `w = 0`, so `y <= 100 * w` holds.
    - **Preservation:** The updates in the loop ensure that `y` does not exceed `100 * w` since `y` is reset to `-y` or incremented in a controlled manner.
    - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `w` has been incremented, and `y` has been manipulated based on the loop's logic.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `y <= 100 * w` and `x < 5`.
  
- **Validity Explanation:**
  - This invariant holds true at the start and end of every iteration due to the structure of the loop. The operations performed on `y` and `w` maintain the relationship throughout iterations.

#### e. Establishment

- The invariant `y <= 100 * w` and `x < 5` is established as follows:
  - Before the loop begins, `y = 0` and `w = 0`, thus `y <= 100 * w` holds (0 <= 0).
  - The initial value of `x` is 0, satisfying `x < 5`.

#### f. Preservation

- The invariant is preserved because:
  - In each iteration, regardless of which branch is taken, the updates to `y` and `w` maintain the relationship `y <= 100 * w`.
  - The increments to `x` keep it below 5 until the loop condition fails.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- Upon termination, the loop condition `unknown()` is false. The state of the variables could be:
  - `x = 5`, `y` could be `<= 100 * w` due to the logic in the loop.
  - The invariant holds since the relationship between `y` and `w` is maintained throughout.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- The post-condition `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` is not directly proven by the invariant since it does not guarantee `y <= 2` during iterations.
- However, if `y` does become less than or equal to 2 upon loop termination, the invariant and the state of `x` can still be shown to comply with the assertion due to the structure of updates in the loop. 

In conclusion, the loop invariant `y <= 100 * w` and `x < 5` is a valid invariant that helps maintain correctness throughout the loop execution, and while it does not directly prove the post-condition, it ensures that certain properties hold true during execution.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;
    w = 0;

2025-12-24 02:53:19,288 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0)**
   - The invariant `y >= 0` is not preserved because within the loop, `y` can be negated when the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true. This means that `y` can become negative, violating the invariant. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to account for the possibility of `y` becoming negative.

2. **Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (x < 5)**
   - The invariant `x < 5` is also not preserved. The loop can increment `x` beyond 5, especially when `x >= 4`, where `x` is incremented by 1. This means that this invariant must be adjusted to reflect the maximum possible value of `x` during the iterations.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)**
   - The assertion cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently constrain the values of `x` and `y` at termination. The loop invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that when the loop exits, the relationship between `y` and `x` supports the assertion.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 2 + 100 * (x < 4 ? 0 : 1))**  
The invariant `y <= 2 + 100 * (x < 4 ? 0 : 1)` fails to preserve its validity after iterations. When `x` reaches 4, the invariant does not adequately account for the possibility of `y` becoming significantly larger due to the operations in the loop (especially `y = y + 100`). This means that as `x` increases, the bound on `y` becomes insufficient, allowing `y` to exceed the established invariant. Therefore, we need to redefine this invariant to ensure it remains valid throughout the iterations.

**Error 2: Goal Assertion (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)**  
The assertion cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently constrain the values of `x` and `y` at termination. Specifically, the invariant `y <= 100 * w` allows `y` to grow too large, and thus does not guarantee that if `y <= 2`, then `x` must be less than 4. We need to strengthen the loop invariant to ensure that the relationship between `y` and `x` supports the assertion.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int z;

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 2 + 100 * (x < 4 ? 0 : 1))**  
The invariant `y <= 2 + 100 * (x < 4 ? 0 : 1)` fails to preserve its validity after iterations. When `x` reaches 4, this invariant does not adequately account for the possibility of `y` becoming larger due to the operations in the loop (especially `y = y + 100`). Therefore, we need to redefine this invariant to ensure it remains valid throughout the iterations.

**Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (x < 5)**  
The invariant `x < 5` is also not preserved. The loop can increment `x` beyond 5, especially when `x >= 4`, where `x` is incremented by 1. This means that this invariant must be adjusted to reflect the maximum possible value of `x` during the iterations.

**Error 3: Goal Assertion (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)**  
The assertion cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently constrain the values of `x` and `y` at termination. Specifically, the invariant `y <= 100 * w` allows `y` to grow too large, and thus does not guarantee that if `y <= 2`, then `x` must be less than 4. We need to strengthen the loop invariant to ensure that the relationship between `y` and `x` supports the assertion.

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;

    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;

2025-12-24 03:02:31,106 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

**Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 2 + 100 * (x < 4 ? 0 : 1))**  
The invariant `y <= 2 + 100 * (x < 4 ? 0 : 1)` is not preserved because when `x` reaches 4, the condition does not hold true for subsequent iterations. Specifically, `y` can become significantly larger when `y` is incremented by 100 in the loop, which means this invariant can be violated. We need to redefine this invariant to ensure it remains valid after each iteration.

**Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (x <= 4)**  
The invariant `x <= 4` is also not preserved. The loop can increment `x` beyond 4, especially when `x` is incremented in the first branch of the conditional statement. This means that this invariant must be adjusted to reflect the maximum possible value of `x` during the iterations.

**Error 3: Goal Assertion (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4)**  
The assertion cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently constrain the values of `x` and `y` at termination. The relationship between `y` and `x` needs to be strengthened to ensure that if `y` is low, then `x` must also be low.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo188() {

    int x;

    x = 0;

2025-12-24 03:09:03,748 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the `foo188` function is to execute a series of operations based on the state of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, which are initialized to zero. The loop continues to execute as long as the function `unknown()` returns true, which is an indeterminate condition. 

The structure of the loop consists of the following components:

- **Governing Condition**: `while(unknown())` - The loop will run indefinitely until `unknown()` returns false.
  
- **Body Operations**:
  - If `x >= 4`, then `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 2.
  - Else if `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, then `y` is negated.
  - Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 100.
  
- **Post-Body Operations**: After the conditional checks, `w` is incremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 10.

The relevant variables for the loop's behavior are `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: 
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. **After 1st iteration**: Depending on the path taken:
     - If `x >= 4`: `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.
     - If `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.
     - Otherwise: `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.
  
  2. **After 2nd iteration**: Continuing from the first iteration:
     - If the first path was taken: `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.
     - If the second path was taken: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.
     - If the third path was taken: `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.

  3. **After 3rd iteration**: Continuing similarly.
  
  4. **After 4th iteration**: Continuing similarly.
  
  5. **After 5th iteration**: Continuing similarly.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: This would depend on when `unknown()` returns false. If it returns false after the 5th iteration, the values will depend on the path taken.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The provided post-condition is `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal is only true at termination and does not hold during iterations of the loop. 

- **Modification of the verification goal**: 
  - We can modify the goal to reflect that `y` will not exceed certain bounds during iterations, e.g., `y <= 100 * (w + 1)` or similar, which could help to ensure that `y` does not grow too large.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `y <= 100 * (w + 1)`.

- **Explanation of Validity**: 
  - This invariant holds because `y` is incremented by at most 100 in each iteration (when `x < 4`), and `w` increments by 1 each iteration. Hence, `y` will not exceed `100 * (w + 1)` during the loop.

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: 
  - Before the loop begins, `y = 0` and `w = 0`, so `y <= 100 * (0 + 1)` holds true.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant**: 
  - If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, then:
    - If `x >= 4`, `y` increases by 2 (still ≤ `100 * (w + 1)`).
    - If `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`, `y` is negated but remains ≤ `100 * (w + 1)` due to the conditions.
    - Otherwise, `y` increases by 100, but `w` has already been incremented, preserving the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State at Termination**: When the loop terminates, `unknown()` is false. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` depend on the path taken but `y` will not exceed `100 * (w + 1)`.

- **Validity of Invariant at Termination**: The invariant remains valid since it was preserved through iterations and will hold when the loop condition is false.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: The post-condition `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` is correct as long as `y` is less than or equal to 2, it implies that `x` must be less than 4.

- **Using Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition**: The invariant `y <= 100 * (w + 1)` ensures that if `y` is indeed less than or equal to 2 at termination, then `x` must also be less than 4, fulfilling the post-condition. 

In conclusion, the loop invariant `y <= 100 * (w + 1)` is a valid invariant that satisfies all necessary conditions for establishment, preservation, and termination, thus supporting the verification goal.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-24 03:09:43,442 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The invariant `y >= 0` is failing to hold after iterations. The operations within the loop can lead to negative values for `y`, especially in the case where `y` is negated (`y = 0 - y;`). This means the invariant `y >= 0` is not preserved across iterations, as `y` can be negative after the negation operation.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4); */` cannot be verified because the existing invariants do not provide sufficient constraints to imply this post-condition. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that when `y` is less than or equal to 2, `x` must also be less than 4.

2025-12-24 03:26:21,002 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the `foo188` function is to perform a series of operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the value returned by the function `unknown()`. The loop continues to execute as long as `unknown()` returns true. The intended outcome appears to be to manipulate these variables in a way that potentially leads to a specific state or condition, although the exact purpose is unclear without additional context regarding the function `unknown()`.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop is governed by the condition `while(unknown())`, which means it will execute as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:**
  1. If `x` is greater than or equal to 4, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  2. If `y` is greater than `10 * w` and `z` is greater than or equal to `100 * x`, negate `y`.
  3. If neither of the above conditions is true, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  4. Increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10 after each iteration.

**Relevant Variables:**
- `x`: Starts at 0, may be incremented based on conditions.
- `y`: Starts at 0, modified based on conditions and can be negated.
- `z`: Starts at 0, incremented by 10 in each iteration.
- `w`: Starts at 0, incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `unknown()` is true and `x < 4`: 
     - `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.
   - If `x >= 4`: 
     - `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 10`, `w = 1` (assuming `x` was initially 4).
   - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`: 
     - `y = 0`, `x` remains unchanged, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - Continuing from iteration 1's results:
     - If `x < 4`: 
       - `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.
     - If `x >= 4`: 
       - `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.
     - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`: 
       - `y = 0`, `x` remains unchanged, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - Continuing from iteration 2's results:
     - If `x < 4`: 
       - `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`.
     - If `x >= 4`: 
       - `x = 3`, `y = 2`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`.
     - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`: 
       - `y = 0`, `x` remains unchanged, `z = 30`, `w = 3`.

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - Continuing from iteration 3's results:
     - If `x < 4`: 
       - `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`.
     - If `x >= 4`: 
       - `x = 4`, `y = 2`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`.
     - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`: 
       - `y = 0`, `x` remains unchanged, `z = 40`, `w = 4`.

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - Continuing from iteration 4's results:
     - If `x < 4`: 
       - `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.
     - If `x >= 4`: 
       - `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.
     - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`: 
       - `y = 0`, `x` remains unchanged, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The final state depends on when `unknown()` returns false. If it returns false after 5 iterations, the values will depend on the last iteration's condition checks.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The verification goal provided is `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`. This means if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true at termination, not necessarily during iterations. During iterations, `y` can exceed 2, and `x` can be incremented beyond 4.

**Modification of the Verification Goal:**
To create a valid invariant, we can modify the verification goal to something like:
- `y <= 2` or `x < 4`.

This modified invariant can be established before the loop starts (since `y` and `x` are both initialized to 0), and we can analyze whether it holds through iterations and at termination.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`(y <= 2) or (x < 4)`

**Validity of the Invariant:**
- This invariant holds true at the start of the loop because both `y` and `x` are initialized to 0.
- As the loop executes, if `x` is incremented to 4 or more, `y` can potentially remain less than or equal to 2, satisfying the invariant. The structure of the loop ensures that one of these conditions will always hold true as the variables are manipulated.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
- Before the loop begins, we have `x = 0` and `y = 0`, which satisfies `y <= 2` (the invariant holds true). 

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
- At the start of each iteration, if `y <= 2`, it remains true as `y` can only increase by 2 or 100, but if it exceeds 2, the condition `x < 4` must hold.
- If `x < 4` at the start, it can increment but will not affect the truth of `y <= 2` until `x` reaches 4.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Relevant Variables at Termination:**
- When the loop terminates, `unknown()` is false. At this point, either `y <= 2` holds or `x < 4` holds, satisfying the invariant.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` is correct.
- The invariant ensures that at termination, if `y` is indeed less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4, thereby fulfilling the post-condition. The invariant and the loop condition's negation (when the loop exits) confirm that the post-condition is satisfied.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-24 03:27:04,850 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0)**:
   - The invariant `y >= 0` fails to be preserved because within the loop, `y` can be negated when the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true. This means that `y` could become negative, violating the invariant after the first iteration. Thus, this invariant must be modified to account for the potential changes to `y`.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant ((y <= 2) || (x < 4))**:
   - The invariant `(y <= 2) || (x < 4)` also fails to be preserved due to the operations performed in the loop. Specifically, `y` can increase significantly (by 100) in the `else` block, which can lead to situations where `y` exceeds 2 while `x` could also be incremented to 4 or more. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure that it holds true after each iteration.

3. **Goal Assertion (assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4))**:
   - The assertion cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently ensure that when `y` is less than or equal to 2, `x` is guaranteed to be less than 4. The invariants must be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be derived from them when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

2025-12-24 03:45:00,846 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo188` is to perform a series of operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the results of the `unknown()` function, which determines whether the loop continues to execute. The loop manipulates these variables in a way that appears to depend on their current values, potentially leading to a condition where certain thresholds are met, thereby influencing the outcome of the function.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues to execute as long as the `unknown()` function returns true.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:**
  - If `x >= 4`, then `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 2.
  - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, then `y` is negated.
  - Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 100.
  - Regardless of the conditions, `w` is incremented by 1, and `z` is incremented by 10.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: Tracks a count that influences the first condition.
  - `y`: A variable that can be modified in several ways depending on conditions.
  - `z`: A variable that accumulates based on the loop iterations.
  - `w`: A counter that influences the second condition.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop begins:
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `unknown()` returns true:
     - `x` could become 1 (if the else condition is hit).
     - `y` could become 100 (if the else condition is hit).
     - `z` becomes 10.
     - `w` becomes 1.

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - Assuming the same conditions hold:
     - `x` could become 2.
     - `y` could become 200.
     - `z` becomes 20.
     - `w` becomes 2.

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - Continuing the same logic:
     - `x` could become 3.
     - `y` could become 300.
     - `z` becomes 30.
     - `w` becomes 3.

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - Continuing the same logic:
     - `x` could become 4.
     - `y` could become 400.
     - `z` becomes 40.
     - `w` becomes 4.

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - Continuing the same logic:
     - `x` could become 5.
     - `y` could become 500.
     - `z` becomes 50.
     - `w` becomes 5.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates after the fifth iteration, the final values would depend on the last evaluation of `unknown()`, which could lead to any number of states.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The provided post-condition is `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);`. This means if `y` is less than or equal to 2, then `x` must be less than 4.

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as a loop invariant because it is only true at termination and does not hold during the iterations of the loop. The values of `y` and `x` can change significantly throughout the loop iterations.

**Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
To create a suitable invariant, we can propose:
- **Invariant:** `y <= 100 * w` and `z <= 10 * (w + 1)`.
This invariant can be established as follows:
- **Establishment:** Initially, `y = 0` and `w = 0`, so `y <= 100 * w` holds.
- **Preservation:** We can analyze each branch of the loop to show that these inequalities hold after each iteration.
- **Termination:** When the loop terminates, we will analyze the conditions to show that the original post-condition is satisfied.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`y <= 100 * w` and `z <= 10 * (w + 1)`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- **Establishment:** Initially, `y = 0` and `w = 0`, so `y <= 100 * w` holds true (0 <= 0). For `z`, since it starts at 0 and `w` is 0, `z <= 10 * (0 + 1)` holds (0 <= 10).
- **Preservation:** Each iteration modifies `y`, `z`, and `w` in such a way that the inequalities are maintained. Increments to `w` increase the upper bounds of `y` and `z`.
- **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `unknown()` is false, and we can derive that the values of `y` and `z` will still satisfy the conditions of the invariant, thus implying the original post-condition.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
Before the first iteration, we have:
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.
Thus:
- `y <= 100 * w` (0 <= 0) holds true.
- `z <= 10 * (w + 1)` (0 <= 10) holds true.

The invariant is established before the loop begins.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
- **If `x >= 4`:** 
  - `x` increments by 1, `y` increments by 2. Since `w` also increments, `y` will still be less than or equal to `100 * w` due to the small increment.
  
- **If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`:**
  - `y` is negated, which keeps it in bounds relative to `w`. The increment of `w` ensures that the upper bound is still valid.
  
- **Else:**
  - `x` increments by 1, `y` increments by 100, and `w` increments by 1. The new values of `y` and `z` remain within the bounds set by the invariant.

In all cases, the invariant holds true at the end of each iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables at Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `unknown()` returns false. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` will depend on the number of iterations executed.

**Why the Loop Invariant Remains Valid:**
The invariant conditions `y <= 100 * w` and `z <= 10 * (w + 1)` will hold true even when the loop exits, as they are constructed based on the increments that occur throughout the loop.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**
The post-condition `assert (y <= 2) ==> (x < 4);` is correct under the assumption that the invariant holds true and the loop has terminated.

**How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
If the invariant holds true at termination, and we have `y <= 2`, then:
- Given `y <= 100 * w`, if `y <= 2`, it implies `w` cannot be too large, thus limiting `x` since `x` cannot reach 4 without causing `y` to exceed the bounds set by `w`.

In conclusion, the loop invariant and its properties ensure that the post-condition is met upon termination of the loop.

2025-12-24 03:45:00,872 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo188() {

    int x;
    int y;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
