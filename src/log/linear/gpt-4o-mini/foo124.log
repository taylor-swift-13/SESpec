#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The loop in the function `foo124` is designed to decrement both `x` and `y` simultaneously until `x` reaches zero. The intended outcome is to ensure that `y` is also decremented to zero, given that `x` starts at a non-negative value.

- **Structure**: 
  - The loop is governed by the condition `while (x != 0)`, meaning it will continue executing as long as `x` is not zero.
  - Inside the loop body, two operations are performed:
    - `x = x - 1;` decrements `x` by 1.
    - `y = y - 1;` decrements `y` by 1.
  - The relevant variables for the loop's behavior are `x`, `y`, `i`, and `j`. Here, `i` and `j` are initialized to the values of `x` and `y` respectively before the loop starts.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Initial values: `i = x`, `j = y`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**: 
    - Before: `x = x`, `y = y`
    - After: `x = x - 1`, `y = y - 1`
  - **Iteration 2**:
    - Before: `x = x - 1`, `y = y - 1`
    - After: `x = x - 2`, `y = y - 2`
  - **Iteration 3**:
    - Before: `x = x - 2`, `y = y - 2`
    - After: `x = x - 3`, `y = y - 3`
  - **Iteration 4**:
    - Before: `x = x - 3`, `y = y - 3`
    - After: `x = x - 4`, `y = y - 4`
  - **Iteration 5**:
    - Before: `x = x - 4`, `y = y - 4`
    - After: `x = x - 5`, `y = y - 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, then `x` will be `initial_x - 5` and `y` will be `initial_y - 5`. If `x` is zero, then `y` must be decremented to `initial_y - initial_x` (if `initial_y >= initial_x`).

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition to prove is `assert (i == j) ==> (y == 0);`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal is only true at termination when `x` becomes zero. It does not hold true during the iterations of the loop because `y` may not be zero while `x` is being decremented.

- **Modification to create a valid invariant**:
  - A suitable invariant could be: `i - j = x - y`, which indicates that the difference between the initial values of `x` and `y` remains constant throughout the loop.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `i - j = x - y`.

- **Explanation of Validity**:
  - This invariant states that the difference between the initial values of `x` and `y` remains unchanged during the loop iterations. This is valid because both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1 in each iteration, maintaining the difference.

#### e. Establishment

- **How the invariant is established**: 
  - Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to `x` and `j` is initialized to `y`, so `i - j = x - y` holds true at the start.

- **Pre-condition guarantees**: 
  - The initial values of `i` and `j` ensure that the invariant is established before the first iteration since both `i` and `j` reflect the initial state of `x` and `y`.

#### f. Preservation

- **How the invariant is preserved**: 
  - At the beginning of each iteration, if `i - j = x - y` holds, then after executing `x = x - 1` and `y = y - 1`, we have:
    - New `x = old x - 1`
    - New `y = old y - 1`
    - Thus, `i - j = (old x - 1) - (old y - 1) = (old x - old y) = x - y`.
  - Therefore, the invariant holds true at the end of each iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of variables upon termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `x` becomes zero. At this point, `y` will have been decremented to `initial_y - initial_x` if `initial_y >= initial_x`, or will be greater than zero if `initial_y < initial_x`.

- **Why the invariant remains valid**: 
  - When the loop condition `x != 0` becomes false, we can still assert the relationship captured by the invariant. The invariant's truth ensures that the relationship between `i`, `j`, `x`, and `y` holds until the loop exits.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the post-condition**: 
  - The post-condition `assert (i == j) ==> (y == 0);` is correct if `i` and `j` are equal at the start, which means `x` and `y` were equal initially. If they are equal, then `y` must be zero when `x` is zero.

- **How the invariant proves the post-condition**: 
  - If `i == j`, it implies that the initial values of `x` and `y` were equal. Thus, when the loop terminates and `x` is zero, `y` must also be zero due to the invariant and the decrement operations, satisfying the post-condition.
