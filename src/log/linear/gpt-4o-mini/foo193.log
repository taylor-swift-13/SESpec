2025-12-24 07:44:39,451 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the provided C code snippet is to increment the variable `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or the variable `b` becomes zero. The intended outcome of the loop is to ensure that `i` does not exceed `n` while also checking the condition of `b`.

The loop's structure is governed by the condition `while(i < n && b != 0)`. This means that the loop will continue executing as long as both `i` is less than `n` and `b` is not equal to zero. The operations performed in the body of the loop consist solely of the statement `i = i + 1`, which increments the value of `i` by 1.

The relevant variables for the behavior of this loop are:
- `i`: an integer that is incremented in each iteration.
- `n`: an integer that serves as the upper bound for `i`.
- `b`: an integer that must not be zero for the loop to continue.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**: Before the loop begins, the initial values of the variables are:
  - `i = 0`
  - `n` (given as a pre-condition that `i < n`, so `n` must be greater than 0)
  - `b` (its value is not defined before the loop)

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **After Iteration 1**: 
    - `i = 1`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **After Iteration 2**: 
    - `i = 2`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **After Iteration 3**: 
    - `i = 3`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **After Iteration 4**: 
    - `i = 4`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **After Iteration 5**: 
    - `i = 5`
    - `b` remains unchanged.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - If the loop terminates because `b` becomes zero, we have `i` at its last value before termination, and `b = 0`. If the loop terminates because `i` reaches `n`, we have `i = n` and `b` remains unchanged (not zero).

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The provided post-condition is `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);`. This means that if `b` is zero when the loop exits, then `i` must be less than `n`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it only holds true at termination (when `b == 0`), not during iterations.

- **Modification of Verification Goal**: 
  - A valid invariant could be: `b != 0` during iterations and `i < n` must hold while `b != 0`.
  - This modified invariant satisfies:
    - **Establishment**: Initially, we have `b` (not defined but assumed non-zero for the loop to start) and `i < n`.
    - **Preservation**: If `b != 0` holds at the start of an iteration, it remains true as `i` increments.
    - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, either `b == 0` or `i >= n`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `b != 0` and `i < n`.

- **Validity Explanation**: 
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - At the start of the loop, `b` must be non-zero for the loop to execute (as `b != 0` is part of the loop condition), and `i` is initialized to 0, satisfying `i < n` if `n > 0`.
    - During each iteration, `i` increments, but `b` remains non-zero until the loop condition fails. Thus, the invariant holds true throughout the iterations.

### e. Establishment

- The proposed invariant `b != 0` and `i < n` is established because:
  - The pre-condition guarantees that `i < n` when the function is called.
  - Although `b` is not defined initially, the loop does not execute unless `b` is non-zero.

### f. Preservation

- The invariant is preserved as follows:
  - If `b != 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration, the loop condition is true, and the loop body executes, incrementing `i`.
  - Since `i` is incremented by 1, it still holds that `i < n` until `i` reaches `n`, thus preserving the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

- When the loop terminates, either `b` becomes zero or `i` reaches `n`.
- If `b` is zero, the invariant `b != 0` is no longer true, but we can conclude that the loop has exited. If `i` reaches `n`, the invariant `i < n` is violated, confirming the loop condition has failed.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- The provided post-condition is correct. It states that if `b == 0`, then `i < n`.
- When the loop exits due to `b == 0`, the invariant holds true because we have established that `b` must have been non-zero during iterations.
- Thus, the invariant and the negation of the loop condition together imply that the post-condition is satisfied. If `b` is zero, `i` could have reached `n` but not exceeded it during the loop, ensuring that the post-condition holds true.

2025-12-24 07:45:18,115 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The current loop invariant `(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < \at(n,Pre));` fails preservation because it does not account for the fact that `i` is incremented in the loop body. After the first iteration, `i` will be at least `1`, and thus the invariant should reflect that `i` can take values from `0` up to but not including `n`. The invariant needs to be modified to ensure that it holds true after each iteration, especially considering that `i` can increment beyond `0` but must remain less than `n`.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` is not correctly implied by the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition. When the loop exits because `b` becomes `0`, it must be ensured that `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the invariant needs to include a condition that guarantees this relationship holds true upon termination of the loop.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

2025-12-24 07:50:25,296 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` fails preservation because it does not account for the fact that `i` is incremented in the loop body. After the first iteration, `i` could be `1`, `2`, etc., but it must always remain less than `n`. The invariant should be adjusted to ensure it holds true after each iteration and reflects that `i` can take values from `0` up to but not including `n`.

2. **Error 2: Goal Establishment of Invariant**
   - The same invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` also fails establishment because it does not hold under the initial conditions specified by the precondition. Specifically, if `b` is undefined or zero at the start, the invariant cannot be established. The invariant should be weakened to accommodate the initial conditions that ensure `i` is less than `n` when the loop begins.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it relies on the invariant that fails both establishment and preservation. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when the loop exits due to `b` being zero, `i` is guaranteed to be less than `n`.

2025-12-24 07:53:51,974 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` fails preservation because it does not adequately account for the fact that `i` is incremented in the loop body. As `i` is incremented, it could potentially reach `n`, violating the invariant. The invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure it holds true after each iteration and reflects that `i` must always be less than `n` as long as `b` is not zero.

2. **Error 2: Goal Establishment of Invariant**
   - The same invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` also fails establishment because it does not hold under the initial conditions specified by the precondition. Specifically, when the function starts, `i` is initialized to `0`, and `b` is not defined. The invariant should be weakened to accommodate these initial conditions, ensuring that it can be established when the loop begins.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it relies on the invariant that fails both establishment and preservation. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when the loop exits due to `b` being zero, `i` is guaranteed to be less than `n`.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;

2025-12-24 08:00:04,929 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the given code snippet is to increment the variable `i` as long as two conditions are met: `i` is less than `n` and the variable `b` is not equal to zero. The intended outcome is to increment `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `b` becomes zero.

The structure of the loop consists of:
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues to execute while `i < n` and `b != 0`.
- **Operations in the Body:** The only operation performed in the body of the loop is `i = i + 1`, which increments `i` by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:** The relevant variables are `i`, `n`, and `b`. Here, `i` is the loop index, `n` is a boundary value, and `b` is a condition that controls the loop's execution.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `i = 0`
  - `n` is provided as an argument (let's assume `n > 0`).
  - `b` is uninitialized at this point, so its value is unknown.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  1. **After Iteration 1:** 
     - `i = 1`, `b` is still unknown (depends on the condition).
  2. **After Iteration 2:** 
     - `i = 2`, `b` is still unknown.
  3. **After Iteration 3:** 
     - `i = 3`, `b` is still unknown.
  4. **After Iteration 4:** 
     - `i = 4`, `b` is still unknown.
  5. **After Iteration 5:** 
     - `i = 5`, `b` is still unknown.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:** 
  - If the loop terminates, it means either `i >= n` or `b == 0`. The state of `i` would be at least `n` or less than `n` depending on the condition of `b`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The post-condition is `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because it is only true at termination (i.e., it describes the relationship between `b` and `i` when the loop ends, not during iterations).

- **Modification for Loop Invariant:**
  - A potential modification could be: `b != 0 ==> (i < n)`. This implies that while `b` is not zero, `i` must remain less than `n`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `b != 0 ==> (i < n)`.
  
- **Validity Explanation:** 
  - This invariant states that if `b` is not zero, then `i` must be less than `n`. It is valid because the loop continues to increment `i` only if `b` is not zero and `i` is less than `n`.

### e. Establishment

- **How the proposed invariant is established:** 
  - Before the loop begins, we have `i = 0`, and we know that `b` is initialized (though its value is unknown). Assuming `b` is not zero at the start, `b != 0` would imply `0 < n` (since `n` is positive). Thus, the invariant holds before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

- **How the invariant is preserved:** 
  - If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`b != 0 ==> (i < n)`) and the loop condition is true (`i < n && b != 0`), then the loop body executes, incrementing `i` by 1. After the increment, if `b` remains non-zero, `i` will still be less than `n` until `i` reaches `n`. Hence, the invariant remains true.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of relevant variables when the loop terminates:** 
  - The loop terminates when either `i >= n` or `b == 0`. If `b == 0`, the invariant `b != 0 ==> (i < n)` is trivially true because the antecedent is false. If `i >= n`, the invariant holds since the condition `b != 0` must have been true in previous iterations.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the post-condition:** 
  - The post-condition `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);` is correct. 

- **How the invariant proves the post-condition:** 
  - When the loop terminates, if `b == 0`, the invariant does not contradict the post-condition since it does not impose any restriction on `i`. If `b != 0`, then the loop must have incremented `i` such that it is still less than `n`, thus satisfying the post-condition. 

In conclusion, the analysis confirms that the loop invariant `b != 0 ==> (i < n)` is valid and preserves the properties needed to ensure the correctness of the program with respect to its post-condition.

2025-12-24 08:00:44,338 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The loop invariant `(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < \at(n,Pre));` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that `i` can be incremented beyond the bounds of `0` and `n` during iterations. After each iteration, if `b` remains non-zero, `i` is incremented, which could lead to `i` being equal to `n` or greater. The invariant must ensure that `i` remains within valid bounds while `b` is non-zero.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because the loop invariant does not sufficiently guarantee that `i` will be less than `n` when `b` becomes zero. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that when the loop terminates, the condition of `i < n` holds true if `b` is zero.

2025-12-24 08:02:26,100 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The loop invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that `i` can be incremented in the loop, which may cause `i` to equal or exceed `n`. Therefore, this invariant must be modified to ensure that it is preserved throughout the loop iterations.

2. **Error 2: Goal Establishment of Invariant**
   - The same invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` fails to hold under the initial conditions. The precondition `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)` suggests that `i` starts at 0, but if `b` is uninitialized, it can lead to situations where the invariant does not hold true at the beginning of the loop. We need to weaken this invariant to accommodate the initial conditions.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that `i` will be less than `n` when `b` becomes zero. We need to strengthen the invariant to ensure that when the loop terminates, the condition of `i < n` holds true if `b` is zero.

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The loop invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that `i` can be incremented beyond `n` during the loop. This invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` remains less than `n` while `b` is non-zero. 

2. **Error 2: Goal Establishment of Invariant**
   - The same invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` also fails to hold under the initial conditions. The precondition `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)` indicates that `i` starts at 0, but if `b` is uninitialized, the invariant might not hold at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, we need to weaken this invariant to be valid under the initial conditions.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not guarantee that `i` will be less than `n` when `b` becomes zero. We need to strengthen the invariant to ensure that when the loop terminates, the condition of `i < n` holds true if `b` is zero.

2025-12-24 08:07:39,115 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The loop invariant `(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (b != 0 ==> (i < n))` is problematic because it does not adequately account for the fact that `i` can be incremented in the loop. The condition `i < n` must be maintained throughout the iterations while `b` is non-zero. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` remains strictly less than `n` during all iterations where `b` is non-zero.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` fails because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that `i` will be less than `n` when `b` becomes zero. To ensure the postcondition can be verified, we need to strengthen the invariant to guarantee that if `b` is zero, then `i` must still satisfy the condition of being less than `n`.

2025-12-24 08:09:46,110 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant**
   - The loop invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` is incorrect because it does not guarantee that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the iterations of the loop. If `b` is non-zero, `i` can still increment and potentially reach or exceed `n`, which violates the invariant. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is always less than `n` while `b` is non-zero.

2. **Error 2: Goal Establishment of Invariant**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` also fails to hold under the initial conditions. The precondition states that `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)`, but if `b` is uninitialized, the invariant may not hold true at the beginning of the loop. We need to weaken this invariant to accommodate the initial conditions, ensuring it holds when entering the loop.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` fails because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that `i` will be less than `n` when `b` becomes zero. We need to strengthen the invariant to ensure that when the loop terminates, the condition `i < n` holds true if `b` is zero.

   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (i < n)` also fails to hold under the initial conditions. The precondition states that `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)`, but if `b` is uninitialized, the invariant might not hold true at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, we need to weaken this invariant to ensure it is valid when entering the loop.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently guarantee that `i` will be less than `n` when `b` becomes zero. We need to strengthen the invariant to ensure that when the loop terminates, the condition of `i < n` holds true if `b` is zero.

2025-12-24 08:15:57,830 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo193` is to increment the variable `i` as long as two conditions are satisfied: `i` must be less than `n` and `b` must not be equal to zero. The intended outcome is to increment `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `b` becomes zero.

The loop's structure consists of the following components:
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues executing as long as `i < n` and `b != 0`.
- **Operations in the Body:** The only operation performed in the loop body is `i = i + 1`, which increments `i` by one.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `i`: an integer that represents the current index or count, which starts at 0 (as set before the loop).
  - `n`: an integer that serves as an upper limit for `i`.
  - `b`: an integer that must not be zero for the loop to continue executing.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Before the loop begins:
    - `i = 0`
    - `n` is provided as an input parameter (assumed `n > 0` from the pre-condition).
    - `b` is uninitialized, but we will assume `b` is initialized before the loop starts.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **Iteration 1:**
    - `i = 1` (after increment)
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **Iteration 2:**
    - `i = 2`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **Iteration 3:**
    - `i = 3`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **Iteration 4:**
    - `i = 4`
    - `b` remains unchanged.
  - **Iteration 5:**
    - `i = 5`
    - `b` remains unchanged.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - If the loop terminates, we have:
    - If `b` becomes zero, `i` could be any value from `0` to `n-1`.
    - If `i` reaches `n`, then `b` could be either zero or non-zero.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The provided post-condition states `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);`
  
- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal is only true at termination (when `b` is zero), not necessarily during iterations of the loop.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**
  - A suitable invariant could be: `i <= n` and `b != 0` (which ensures that as long as `b` is not zero, `i` will remain less than or equal to `n`).

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `i <= n` and `b != 0`
  
- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - This invariant holds because:
    - Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to `0`, which is less than `n`, and we assume `b` is not zero.
    - During each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`, and the loop continues only if `b` is not zero, thus maintaining the invariant.

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of Invariant:**
  - The invariant `i <= n` and `b != 0` is established before the first iteration because:
    - Initially, `i = 0`, which is less than `n` (given by the pre-condition `i < n`).
    - We assume `b` is initialized to a non-zero value before entering the loop.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of Invariant:**
  - If the invariant `i <= n` and `b != 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration:
    - The loop condition `i < n && b != 0` ensures that `b` remains non-zero.
    - At the end of the iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`, but the loop only continues if `i` is still less than `n` (due to the loop condition).
    - Thus, the invariant is preserved after each iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables upon Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when either `i >= n` or `b == 0`.
  - If `b == 0`, then `i` must be less than `n` due to the invariant.
  - If `i >= n`, the loop condition fails, and `b` must be non-zero (as per the invariant).

- **Validity of Invariant at Termination:**
  - The invariant holds true at termination because if `b == 0`, then the invariant ensures `i < n`.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition:**
  - The post-condition `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);` is correct because:
    - If `b` is zero at termination, the loop invariant guarantees that `i` must be less than `n`.
  
- **How the invariant proves the post-condition:**
  - The invariant `i <= n` and `b != 0` ensures that if the loop exits due to `b` becoming zero, `i` must still be less than `n`, satisfying the post-condition. Thus, the invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition, supports the correctness of the post-condition.

2025-12-24 08:15:57,856 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre) && undef_data_at(&b) * (n == \at(n,Pre)) * (i == 0)`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@

      }

2025-12-24 08:15:57,856 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre) && undef_data_at(&b) * (n == \at(n,Pre)) * (i == 0)`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;


    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant (0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (PLACE_HOLDER_i) ;
          loop invariant (!(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0)) ==> ((n == \at(n,Pre))&&(i == 0));
          loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
            */

       i = i + 1;
      }

2025-12-24 08:18:55,435 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the current loop invariant is fundamentally flawed. 

1. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:** The invariant `(b == 0) ==> (i <= n)` does not hold under the initial conditions specified by the precondition. Specifically, when entering the loop, `i` is initialized to `0`, and `b` could be undefined or non-zero. Therefore, this invariant fails to establish a relationship that holds true before the loop begins.

2. **Goal Assertion:** The assertion `(b == 0) ==> (i < n)` cannot be verified because the invariant does not sufficiently ensure that `i` is less than `n` when `b` is zero. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that if the loop exits due to `b` being zero, the value of `i` must still be less than `n`.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we need to create a set of conditions that:
- Establishes that `i` is always within valid bounds.
- Preserves the relationship between `b` and `i` throughout the loop iterations.
- Ensures that when the loop terminates, the assertion can be derived from the invariant.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;

2025-12-24 08:31:32,067 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo193` is to increment the variable `i` while the condition `i < n` is true and the variable `b` is not equal to zero. The intended outcome of the loop is to continue incrementing `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `b` becomes zero. 

The loop's structure is governed by the condition `while(i < n && b != 0)`, which means that the loop will continue executing as long as both `i` is less than `n` and `b` is not zero. Inside the loop body, the only operation performed is `i = i + 1`, which increments `i` by one. The variable `b` is relevant to the loop's behavior as it determines whether the loop will continue executing or terminate.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `i`: 0 (as it is explicitly set to 0 before the loop)
  - `n`: a value greater than 0 (as per the pre-condition `i < n`)
  - `b`: its initial value is unspecified, but it must not be zero for the loop to execute.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **After Iteration 1:**
    - `i`: 1
    - `b`: remains unchanged
  - **After Iteration 2:**
    - `i`: 2
    - `b`: remains unchanged
  - **After Iteration 3:**
    - `i`: 3
    - `b`: remains unchanged
  - **After Iteration 4:**
    - `i`: 4
    - `b`: remains unchanged
  - **After Iteration 5:**
    - `i`: 5
    - `b`: remains unchanged

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, we would have:
    - `i`: 5 (if `n > 5` and `b` remains non-zero until then)
    - `b`: remains unchanged (but could be 0 if it changed during iterations).

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:**
  - The verification goal is to prove that `b == 0` implies `i < n` at the end of the loop.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal `b == 0 ==> i < n` cannot be used as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true at termination, not during the iterations of the loop.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**
  - A suitable invariant could be: `b != 0 ==> i < n`. This means that while `b` is not zero, `i` must be less than `n`.
  - **Establishment:** This invariant holds before the first iteration since `b` is assumed not to be zero for the loop to execute.
  - **Preservation:** If `b != 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration and `i < n` is true, then incrementing `i` will still keep `i < n` until `i` reaches `n`.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, either `b` is zero or `i` is no longer less than `n`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:**
  - `b != 0 ==> i < n`

- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - This invariant is valid because:
    - If `b` is not zero, then `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing. 
    - The invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop and will be maintained through the loop's iterations as long as `b` remains non-zero.

### e. Establishment

- **How the proposed invariant is established:**
  - The invariant `b != 0 ==> i < n` is established because the loop only executes when `b` is not zero, and `i` starts at 0, which is less than any positive `n`.

- **Pre-condition guarantee:**
  - The pre-condition `i < n` guarantees that when the loop starts, `i` is indeed less than `n`, thus satisfying the invariant condition.

### f. Preservation

- **How the invariant is preserved:**
  - If `b != 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration and the loop condition `i < n` is true, then after the increment `i = i + 1`, `i` will still be less than `n` until it reaches `n`.
  
- **Demonstration of preservation:**
  - Assume at the start of an iteration, `b != 0` and `i < n`. After executing `i = i + 1`, if `i` becomes equal to `n`, the loop will terminate because the condition `i < n` will be false, thus preserving the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of relevant variables upon termination:**
  - When the loop terminates, either `b` is zero or `i` is equal to `n`. If `b` is zero, the invariant `b != 0 ==> i < n` is trivially true because the antecedent is false. If `i` is equal to `n`, then the invariant is still satisfied since the condition for the loop to execute was that `b` was not zero.

- **Why the invariant remains valid:**
  - The invariant is valid at termination because it does not contradict the state of the variables. The termination condition implies that either `b` has become zero, or `i` has reached `n`, which aligns with the invariant.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the provided post-condition:**
  - The post-condition `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);` is **incorrect**. It should be `assert (b == 0) ==> (i >= n);` because if `b` is zero, the loop has terminated, and `i` must be equal to or greater than `n` (the loop stops when `i` reaches `n`).

- **How the invariant proves the post-condition:**
  - The invariant `b != 0 ==> i < n` combined with the negation of the loop condition (which means `b` must be zero) shows that when the loop exits, `i` must be at least `n`, confirming the correct relationship.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.

Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre) && undef_data_at(&b) * (n == \at(n,Pre)) * (i == 0)`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;

2025-12-24 08:31:32,094 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre) && undef_data_at(&b) * (n == \at(n,Pre)) * (i == 0)`

Loop program: `

/*@
    requires i < n;

2025-12-24 08:32:09,077 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The original invariant `(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < \at(n,Pre));` fails to be preserved after each iteration. This means that after incrementing `i`, the invariant does not hold. The invariant needs to ensure that even after the increment, `i` remains within valid bounds based on the value of `b`.

2. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not correctly relate to the state of `i` when `b` becomes zero. The postcondition should ensure that if `b` is zero, then `i` must be at least `n`, as the loop terminates when either condition fails.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;

2025-12-24 08:38:55,562 - DEBUG  - regen reasoning
2025-12-24 08:38:55,563 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (b != 0 ==> i < n)` fails preservation because it does not correctly account for the fact that `i` is incremented in the loop. After each iteration, if `b` is still not zero, `i` must still be less than `n` for the loop to continue. However, this invariant does not ensure that `i` remains less than `n` after the increment operation. 

2. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not correctly relate the state of `i` when `b` becomes zero with the termination of the loop. The postcondition should ensure that if `b` is zero, then `i` must be at least `n`, as the loop stops when `i` reaches `n`.

To address these issues, we need to regenerate the loop invariants to ensure that they are both valid at the start and preserved through each iteration, while also ensuring they imply the postcondition when the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;

2025-12-24 08:45:58,416 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo193` is to increment the variable `i` while certain conditions are met. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n` and the variable `b` is not equal to zero. The intended outcome is to increment `i` until either `i` reaches `n` or `b` becomes zero.

The loop's structure consists of a `while` statement with the condition `i < n && b != 0`. The operations performed within the loop body consist solely of the statement `i = i + 1`, which increments the value of `i` by 1.

Relevant variables include:
- `i`: The index that is incremented during the loop.
- `n`: The upper limit for `i`.
- `b`: A variable that, if equal to zero, will terminate the loop.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop begins, we have:
  - `i = 0` (set by the function)
  - `n`: Some positive integer greater than `i` (given pre-condition `i < n`)
  - `b`: Its value is unknown at this point.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `b`: remains unchanged (unknown).
   
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `i = 2`
   - `b`: remains unchanged (unknown).
   
3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `i = 3`
   - `b`: remains unchanged (unknown).
   
4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `i = 4`
   - `b`: remains unchanged (unknown).
   
5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `i = 5`
   - `b`: remains unchanged (unknown).

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates, `i` will be equal to `n` or `b` will be zero.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal (post-condition) is `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);`.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because it is only true at termination and not necessarily during the iterations of the loop. During iterations, `b` may not be zero, and `i` will be less than `n` as it is being incremented.

**Modifications to create a valid invariant:**
- We can modify the verification goal to state that `b != 0` implies `i < n` during iterations. Thus, we can propose the invariant:
  - **Invariant:** `b != 0 ==> (i < n)`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- `b != 0 ==> (i < n)`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant asserts that as long as `b` is not zero, `i` must be less than `n`. This holds true at the beginning of the loop since `i` starts at `0` and the pre-condition guarantees `i < n`. As `i` increments, the invariant must hold until `b` becomes zero or `i` reaches `n`.

### e. Establishment

**How the proposed invariant is established:**
- Before the first iteration, `i` is initialized to `0`, and the pre-condition guarantees that `i < n`. Therefore, if `b` is not zero (which we do not know), the invariant `b != 0 ==> (i < n)` holds true.

### f. Preservation

**How the invariant is preserved:**
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `b != 0` implies `i < n`), then after executing `i = i + 1`, we have:
  - If `b != 0`, then `i` increments to `i + 1`, and we must check if `i + 1 < n` still holds.
  - Since the loop condition `i < n` must be true for the loop to execute, the invariant is preserved.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of relevant variables upon termination:**
- The loop terminates when either `i >= n` or `b == 0`. 
- If `b == 0`, the invariant `b != 0 ==> (i < n)` is vacuously true because the antecedent is false.
- If `i >= n`, then `b` must have been non-zero for the loop to continue, hence the invariant holds.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the provided post-condition:**
- The post-condition `assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n);` is correct because if `b` is zero, it does not matter what `i` is; the implication holds true.

**How the invariant and negation of the loop condition prove the post-condition:**
- When the loop exits, if `b == 0`, the invariant guarantees that this condition holds, and thus the post-condition is satisfied. If `b != 0`, the loop must have terminated because `i` reached `n`, which also satisfies the post-condition. Thus, the invariant in conjunction with the loop's termination condition supports the correctness of the post-condition.

2025-12-24 08:46:39,122 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(0 < \at(n,Pre) && b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < \at(n,Pre));` fails preservation because it does not adequately account for the increment operation on `i`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented, and the invariant must ensure that `i` remains within the bounds of `0` and `n`. The invariant should reflect that if `b` is not zero, then `i` must be less than `n` throughout the loop.

2. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not sufficiently connect the invariant to the post-condition. The invariant must ensure that when the loop exits (specifically when `b` becomes zero), it implies that `i` must be less than `n`. Thus, the invariant should directly relate to the values of `i` and `b` in such a way that the assertion can be derived.

### Fixed C Code:

```c

2025-12-24 08:48:47,296 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` fails preservation because it does not account for the possibility that `i` can increment beyond `n` if `b` is not zero. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the loop iterations, and we need to express this condition in a way that can be maintained through the loop's body.

2. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` also fails establishment because the initial conditions (`\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)`) and the undefined nature of `b` do not guarantee that `i` will start from a valid state that meets the invariant. The invariant should be weakened to reflect the initial conditions appropriately.

3. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not sufficiently relate the loop invariant to the post-condition. The invariant must ensure that if `b` becomes zero, then `i` must be less than `n`. This requires strengthening the invariant to connect `b` and `i` effectively.

### Fixed C Code:

```c

    requires i < n;

2025-12-24 08:53:01,560 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` fails preservation because it does not account for the fact that `i` is incremented in the loop. After the first iteration, `i` can be incremented to `1`, `2`, ..., up to `n`, which may violate the invariant if `b` is still non-zero. The invariant must ensure that `i` remains strictly less than `n` whenever `b` is not zero.

2. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` also fails establishment because the initial conditions (`\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)`) do not guarantee that `i` starts from a valid state that meets the invariant. The invariant should be weakened to reflect the initial conditions appropriately. For instance, it should allow for the case where `i` starts at `0` and must be less than `n`.

3. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not sufficiently relate the loop invariant to the post-condition. The invariant must ensure that if `b` becomes zero, then `i` must be less than `n`. This requires strengthening the invariant to connect `b` and `i` effectively.

2025-12-24 08:57:15,448 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` fails preservation because it does not adequately account for the increment operation on `i`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented, and the invariant must ensure that `i` remains within the bounds of `0` and `n`. The invariant should be adjusted to reflect that if `b` is not zero, then `i` must be strictly less than `n` for every iteration.

2. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` also fails establishment because the initial conditions (`\at(i,Pre) < \at(n,Pre)`) do not guarantee that `i` starts from a valid state that meets the invariant. The invariant should be weakened to reflect the initial conditions appropriately, allowing for the case where `i` starts at `0` and must be less than `n`.

3. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not sufficiently relate the loop invariant to the post-condition. The invariant must ensure that if `b` becomes zero, then `i` must be less than `n`. This requires strengthening the invariant to connect `b` and `i` effectively.

2025-12-24 09:01:39,023 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` fails preservation because it does not ensure that `i` remains less than `n` after each iteration. Since `i` is incremented in the loop, this invariant needs to explicitly state that if `b` is not zero, then `i` must be strictly less than `n` throughout the iterations. 

2. **Goal Establishment of Invariant:**
   - The invariant `(b != 0) ==> (0 <= i < n)` also fails establishment because the initial conditions do not guarantee that `i` will start from a valid state that meets the invariant. The invariant should be weakened to allow for the possibility that `i` starts at `0` and must be less than `n`, particularly when `b` is not defined initially.

3. **Goal Assertion:**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */` cannot be verified because it does not sufficiently relate the loop invariant to the post-condition. The invariant must ensure that if `b` becomes zero, then `i` must be less than `n`. This requires strengthening the invariant to effectively connect `b` and `i`.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
/*@
    requires i < n;
    */
    
void foo193(int i, int n) {

    int b;

    i = 0;

            loop invariant n == \at(n,Pre);
            */
            while(i < n && b != 0){
       i = i + 1;
      }
            

    /*@ assert (b == 0) ==> (i < n); */
