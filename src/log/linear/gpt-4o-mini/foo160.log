#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the given code is to decrement two variables, `x` and `y`, simultaneously until `x` reaches zero. The intended outcome is to ensure that `y` also reaches zero when `x` is decremented to zero, provided that `i` is equal to `j` at the start.

The loop's structure is defined by the condition `while(x != 0)`, which governs its execution. The operations performed in the loop body are:
- `x = x - 1;` (decrementing `x` by 1)
- `y = y - 1;` (decrementing `y` by 1)

The relevant variables affecting the loop's behavior are:
- `x`: The loop counter, which dictates how many iterations the loop will execute.
- `y`: A variable that is decremented in parallel with `x`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x = i`
  - `y = j`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - **Iteration 1:**
    - After the first iteration: `x = i - 1`, `y = j - 1`
  - **Iteration 2:**
    - After the second iteration: `x = i - 2`, `y = j - 2`
  - **Iteration 3:**
    - After the third iteration: `x = i - 3`, `y = j - 3`
  - **Iteration 4:**
    - After the fourth iteration: `x = i - 4`, `y = j - 4`
  - **Iteration 5:**
    - After the fifth iteration: `x = i - 5`, `y = j - 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - If `x` reaches zero (i.e., `i <= 5`), then upon termination: `x = 0`, `y = j - i`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The goal is to prove the post-condition: `assert (i == j) ==> (y == 0);`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it only holds true at termination (when the loop exits) and not during iterations.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**
  - A potential modified invariant could be: `y = j - (i - x)`, which indicates that `y` decreases in correspondence to `x`.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration, `y = j - (i - x)` holds true.

- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - Initially, when the loop starts, `x = i` and `y = j`, thus `y = j - (i - i) = j`, which is true.
  - After each iteration, `x` decreases by 1 and `y` also decreases by 1, maintaining the relationship `y = j - (i - x)`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant:**
  - Before the loop begins, `x = i` and `y = j`, so `y = j - (i - x)` holds true since `i - x = 0`.
  
- **Pre-condition Guarantee:**
  - The pre-condition ensures that `x` is initialized to `i` and `y` to `j`, thus establishing the invariant holds true at the start.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant:**
  - If the invariant `y = j - (i - x)` holds at the start of an iteration, then at the end of the iteration:
    - `x` becomes `x - 1` and `y` becomes `y - 1`.
    - Thus, `y` updates to `y - 1 = (j - (i - x)) - 1 = j - (i - (x - 1))`, which shows that the invariant holds at the end of the iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State at Termination:**
  - When the loop terminates, `x = 0`. Therefore, `y = j - (i - 0) = j - i`.

- **Invariant Validity at Termination:**
  - Since the loop condition is false when `x = 0`, the invariant `y = j - (i - x)` becomes `y = j - i`, which is valid and can be used to analyze the post-condition.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition:**
  - The post-condition `assert (i == j) ==> (y == 0);` is correct. If `i == j`, then `y = j - i = 0`.

- **Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:**
  - When the loop terminates, `x = 0` implies `y = j - i`. If `i == j`, then `y == 0`, thus confirming the post-condition is satisfied.

In conclusion, the loop invariant `y = j - (i - x)` is valid and correctly establishes the relationship between `y`, `j`, and `x` throughout the loop's execution, ensuring the correctness of the post-condition.
