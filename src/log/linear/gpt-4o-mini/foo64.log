#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The loop in the function `foo64` is designed to decrement the variable `y` from its initial value (10) down to 0, based on the value of `x`, which increments from 1 to 10. The intended outcome is to ensure that after the loop completes, `y` will be less than 10.

- **Structure**: 
  - The loop is governed by the condition `while (x <= 10)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to 10.
  - Within the loop body, the following operations occur:
    - `y` is updated to `10 - x`, effectively decrementing `y` as `x` increases.
    - `x` is incremented by 1 with `x = x + 1`.
  - Relevant variables:
    - `x`: starts at 1 and increments up to 10.
    - `y`: is modified in each iteration based on the current value of `x`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Before the loop starts:
    - `x = 1`
    - `y = <initial value (not specified in the snippet)>`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After iteration 1:
    - `x = 2`, `y = 10 - 1 = 9`
  - After iteration 2:
    - `x = 3`, `y = 10 - 2 = 8`
  - After iteration 3:
    - `x = 4`, `y = 10 - 3 = 7`
  - After iteration 4:
    - `x = 5`, `y = 10 - 4 = 6`
  - After iteration 5:
    - `x = 6`, `y = 10 - 5 = 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - After the loop terminates (when `x = 11`):
    - `x = 11`, `y = 10 - 10 = 0`

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition we need to prove is `assert (y < 10);`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal `y < 10` is only guaranteed at termination (when the loop condition is false). During iterations, `y` can be equal to or greater than 10.

- **Modification of the verification goal**: 
  - We can modify the goal to state that `y` is always less than or equal to 10 during the loop iterations. 
  - Proposed modified invariant: `y = 10 - (x - 1)` (which means `y` decreases as `x` increases).

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration, `y = 10 - (x - 1)`.

- **Validity Explanation**:
  - This invariant holds true at the beginning of the first iteration (when `x = 1`, `y = 9`).
  - It is preserved through each iteration as `x` increments and `y` is recalculated as `10 - x`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the invariant**: 
  - Before the first iteration, when `x = 1`, `y` is initialized to `10 - (1 - 1) = 10`, thus `y` is not less than 10 but holds `y = 10 - 0`.
  
- **Pre-condition guarantee**: 
  - The pre-condition that `y` starts at a certain value (which is not explicitly defined but must be 10 or greater for the invariant to hold) ensures the invariant is established at the start.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the invariant**: 
  - If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, i.e., `y = 10 - (x - 1)`, and the loop condition `x <= 10` is true, then at the end of the iteration, `y` is updated to `10 - x` (which equals `10 - (x - 1) - 1`), maintaining the invariant.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of variables upon termination**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `x = 11` and `y = 10 - 10 = 0`.

- **Validity of the invariant at termination**: 
  - The invariant `y = 10 - (x - 1)` at termination yields `y = 0`, which is consistent with the invariant being valid at termination.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the post-condition**: 
  - The post-condition `assert (y < 10);` is correct since `y = 0` when the loop terminates, which satisfies the condition.

- **Justification**: 
  - The invariant `y = 10 - (x - 1)` implies that as `x` reaches 11, `y` must be 0, thus `y < 10` holds true when the loop condition is false. Therefore, the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition confirms the post-condition.
