2025-12-24 09:14:50,686 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo221` is to modify the values of the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the results of the `unknown()` function. The loop continues executing as long as `unknown()` returns true. Inside the loop, there are two branches: if `unknown()` returns true, both `w` and `x` are incremented; otherwise, `y` and `z` are decremented. 

The governing condition for the loop is `while(unknown())`, meaning the loop will continue executing as long as the `unknown()` function returns true. The operations performed in the loop body involve modifying the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the outcome of another call to `unknown()`.

Relevant variables:
- `w`: incremented when the first `unknown()` is true.
- `x`: also incremented when the first `unknown()` is true.
- `y`: decremented when the first `unknown()` is false.
- `z`: also decremented when the first `unknown()` is false.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

#### Pre-Loop Sampling
Before the loop begins, the variables are initialized as follows:
- `w`: some positive integer (initial value from input)
- `x`: some positive integer (initial value from input)
- `y`: some positive integer (initial value from input)
- `z`: some positive integer (initial value from input)

Let's assume:
- `w = 1`
- `x = 2`
- `y = 3`
- `z = 4`

#### Post-Iteration Sampling
We will analyze the values of the variables after each iteration, assuming the `unknown()` function behaves in a hypothetical manner:

1. **After Iteration 1**:
   - If `unknown()` returns true, `w = 2`, `x = 3`, `y = 3`, `z = 4`.
   - If `unknown()` returns false, `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`.

2. **After Iteration 2**:
   - Continuing from the first scenario (true):
     - If true again: `w = 3`, `x = 4`, `y = 3`, `z = 4`.
     - If false: `w = 2`, `x = 3`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`.
   - Continuing from the second scenario (false):
     - If true: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 2`.
     - If false: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 2`.

3. **After Iteration 3**:
   - Continuing from the first scenario (true):
     - If true again: `w = 4`, `x = 5`, `y = 3`, `z = 4`.
     - If false: `w = 3`, `x = 4`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`.
   - Continuing from the second scenario (false):
     - If true: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`.
     - If false: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`.

4. **After Iteration 4**:
   - Continuing from the first scenario (true):
     - If true again: `w = 5`, `x = 6`, `y = 3`, `z = 4`.
     - If false: `w = 4`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`.
   - Continuing from the second scenario (false):
     - If true: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = -1`, `z = 0`.
     - If false: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = -1`, `z = 0`.

5. **After Iteration 5**:
   - Continuing from the first scenario (true):
     - If true again: `w = 6`, `x = 7`, `y = 3`, `z = 4`.
     - If false: `w = 5`, `x = 6`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`.
   - Continuing from the second scenario (false):
     - If true: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = -2`, `z = -1`.
     - If false: `w = 1`, `x = 2`, `y = -2`, `z = -1`.

#### Post-Loop Sampling
If the loop terminates after five iterations, we need to evaluate the final values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

Assuming the loop condition `unknown()` becomes false after several iterations, we may end up with:
- `w = 6`
- `x = 7`
- `y = -2`
- `z = -1`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal, as stated in the post-condition, is `assert y == z;`. 

#### Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?
- **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because it only holds true at termination and is not guaranteed to be true during the iterations of the loop.

#### Modifying the verification goal
To create a valid invariant, we can modify it to reflect the relationship between `y` and `z` throughout the iterations. 

**Proposed Invariant**: 
- `y + z = constant` (where `constant` is the initial value of `y + z`).

**Establishment**: Before the loop starts, we have `y + z = 3 + 4 = 7`.

**Preservation**: 
- If `unknown()` is true, `w` and `x` are incremented, but `y` and `z` remain unchanged, so `y + z` is preserved.
- If `unknown()` is false, both `y` and `z` are decremented by 1, which maintains the invariant since the sum decreases by 2.

**Termination**: When the loop terminates, `y + z` is still equal to the initial value, which implies that they are equal when the loop ends.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant**: `y + z = initial_value`, where `initial_value` is the sum of the initial values of `y` and `z`.

#### Explanation of Validity
This invariant holds because:
- **Establishment**: Initially, `y + z = 3 + 4 = 7`.
- **Preservation**: If `unknown()` is true, the invariant is unchanged; if false, both `y` and `z` are decremented equally, thus preserving the invariant.
- **Termination**: When the loop exits, the invariant guarantees that `y + z` equals its initial value, which can be manipulated to show that `y = z` under certain conditions.

### e. Establishment

The proposed invariant is established because the pre-condition `x > 0 && y > 0 && z > 0 && w > 0` guarantees that `y` and `z` start as positive integers. Thus, before the loop starts, the invariant `y + z = initial_value` holds true.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved as follows:
- When the loop condition is true, if `unknown()` is true, `y` and `z` remain unchanged, and hence `y + z` remains constant.
- If `unknown()` is false, both `y` and `z` are decremented by 1, preserving the invariant because the change is equal on both sides.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, the values of `y` and `z` will have been modified according to the operations within the loop. However, the invariant `y + z = initial_value` remains valid. 

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `assert y == z;` is not inherently correct based on the loop's behavior. However, if we ensure through our invariant that `y + z` remains constant, we can show that `y` and `z` will reach a point where they equal each other.

The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition, shows that the relationship between `y` and `z` holds true at termination, thus proving the post-condition can be satisfied under the right circumstances.

- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.

2025-12-24 09:14:50,712 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `\at(x,Pre) > 0 && \at(y,Pre) > 0 && \at(z,Pre) > 0 && \at(w,Pre) > 0 && (z == \at(y,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre)) * (x == \at(w,Pre)) * (w == \at(w,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires x > 0 && y > 0 && z > 0 && w > 0;
    */
    
void foo221(int w, int x, int y, int z) {


    x = w;
    z = y;
