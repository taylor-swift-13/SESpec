#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo187` is to perform a series of updates to the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions that depend on the current values of these variables. The loop continues executing as long as the function `unknown()` returns true, which is an unspecified condition that can lead to unpredictable behavior.

The structure of the loop is as follows:

- **Governing Condition**: `while(unknown())`
- **Body Operations**:
  - If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
  - Else if `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
  - Else, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.
  - Regardless of the above conditions, increment `w` by 1 and `z` by 10.

The relevant variables are:
- `x`: A counter that affects the first condition.
- `y`: A variable that can be reset or incremented based on conditions.
- `z`: A variable that accumulates a value based on `x`.
- `w`: A counter that increments with each loop iteration.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  1. **After Iteration 1**:
     - If `unknown()` is true, assume `x` increments to `1`, `y` increments to `100`, `w` becomes `1`, and `z` becomes `10`.
     - Sample: `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.
  
  2. **After Iteration 2**:
     - Assume `x` increments to `2`, `y` increments to `200`, `w` becomes `2`, and `z` becomes `20`.
     - Sample: `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.
  
  3. **After Iteration 3**:
     - Assume `x` increments to `3`, `y` increments to `300`, `w` becomes `3`, and `z` becomes `30`.
     - Sample: `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`.
  
  4. **After Iteration 4**:
     - Assume `x` increments to `4`, `y` increments to `400`, `w` becomes `4`, and `z` becomes `40`.
     - Sample: `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`.
  
  5. **After Iteration 5**:
     - Assume `x` increments to `5`, `y` increments to `500`, `w` becomes `5`, and `z` becomes `50`.
     - Sample: `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, the final values could be `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition to prove is `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);`

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only true at termination, not necessarily during iterations.

- **Modification of Verification Goal**: 
  - We can modify the goal to a more general form: `if x >= 4 then y > 2 holds at the end of the loop`. This can serve as a valid invariant.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `If x >= 4, then y > 2 holds true at the end of each iteration.`

- **Explanation of Validity**: 
  - This invariant captures the essence of the verification goal and is structured to hold true throughout the loop's execution. It directly ties the condition of `x` to the state of `y`.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of Invariant**: 
  - Before the first iteration, `x = 0` and `y = 0`. The invariant does not apply since `x < 4`. Therefore, the invariant is trivially satisfied.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of Invariant**: 
  - We analyze the three branches of the loop:
    1. If `x >= 4`: `x` increments by 1 and `y` increments by 2. The invariant holds as `y` increases.
    2. If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`: `y` is negated, but since `x` is still at least 4, `y` can be checked post-negation to see if it still satisfies the invariant.
    3. In the last case, `x` increments by 1 and `y` increments by 100, preserving the invariant.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination**: 
  - When the loop terminates, `unknown()` returns false. At this point, `x` could be `5`, and `y` would have been updated to be greater than `2` if `x` reached `4` during iterations.

- **Validity of Invariant on Termination**: 
  - The invariant holds as it implies that if `x >= 4`, then `y > 2` is guaranteed when the loop ends.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: 
  - The post-condition `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);` is correct based on our invariant analysis.

- **Proof of Post-condition**: 
  - The invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition (which signifies the loop has finished), confirms that if `x` is at least `4`, then `y` must be greater than `2`, thus satisfying the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 22:46:51,601 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

2025-12-23 22:47:41,484 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The current invariant `y >= 0` is not preserved after each iteration of the loop. The body of the loop modifies `y` in ways that can lead to negative values. For instance, if the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true, `y` is negated (`y = 0 - y`), which can result in `y` becoming negative. This indicates that the invariant needs to be redefined to ensure it remains valid after each iteration.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when the loop exits, the post-condition can be derived from the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition. This suggests that the invariant needs to include conditions that relate `x` and `y` more directly, especially in scenarios where `x` reaches or exceeds 4.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo187() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;

2025-12-23 23:02:47,035 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The invariant `(x >= 4 ==> y >= 2)` fails preservation because when `x` is incremented and is less than 4, `y` can be modified in ways that do not guarantee it will be at least 2 when `x` reaches 4. Specifically, if `y` is reset to a negative value, the invariant will not hold.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The invariant `(y >= 100 * (x - 4))` also fails preservation because it does not account for the fact that `y` can be negated in certain conditions, making it impossible to maintain this relationship after the loop iterations.

3. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified because the invariants do not sufficiently establish the relationship needed to imply this assertion. When `x` reaches 4, `y` may not be guaranteed to be greater than 2 due to the potential modifications of `y`.

To regenerate the loop invariants, we need to ensure that they are robust enough to handle the modifications to `y` and maintain valid relationships throughout the loop's execution.

### Fixed C Code:

2025-12-23 23:05:49,076 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the `foo187` function is to perform a series of updates to the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions that depend on the current values of these variables. The loop continues to execute as long as the `unknown()` function returns true. The intended outcome appears to be to modify `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` until a certain condition (as determined by `unknown()`) is no longer satisfied.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop is governed by the condition `while(unknown())`, meaning it will continue executing as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations Performed in the Body:**
  - If `x >= 4`, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is incremented by 2.
  - If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, `y` is negated.
  - Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1, and `y` is incremented by 100.
  - `w` is incremented by 1 in every iteration.
  - `z` is incremented by 10 in every iteration.
- **Relevant Variables:** The variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are relevant to the loop's behavior, as they are modified based on the conditions and contribute to the loop's exit condition.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values before the loop:
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After 1st iteration:**
   - If `unknown()` is true, since `x < 4`, the `else` block executes:
     - `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `w = 1`, `z = 10`
2. **After 2nd iteration:**
   - `x < 4`, so again the `else` block executes:
     - `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `w = 2`, `z = 20`
3. **After 3rd iteration:**
   - `x < 4`, so again the `else` block executes:
     - `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `w = 3`, `z = 30`
4. **After 4th iteration:**
   - `x < 4`, so again the `else` block executes:
     - `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `w = 4`, `z = 40`
5. **After 5th iteration:**
   - If `unknown()` is still true and `x >= 4`, the `if` block executes:
     - `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `w = 5`, `z = 50`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If `unknown()` returns false after the 5th iteration, we would have:
  - Final values: `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `w = 5`, `z = 50`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The provided post-condition is `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);`.

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as Part of the Loop Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it only holds true at termination and not necessarily during every iteration of the loop. For example, during the iterations when `x < 4`, `y` can take values that do not satisfy `y > 2`.

**Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
To create a valid invariant, we can modify the verification goal to:
- `x >= 0` (always true before the loop starts) and `y >= 0` (also always true).
This invariant can be established as follows:
- **Establishment:** At the start, `x = 0` and `y = 0`.
- **Preservation:** If `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` before the iteration, they will remain non-negative due to the operations in the loop.
- **Termination:** If the loop terminates, we can check that `x >= 4` implies `y > 2` since `y` is updated based on the conditions related to `x`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
The loop invariant can be stated as: 
- `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.

**Validity of the Invariant:**
- This invariant is valid because:
  - **At the start:** `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, thus satisfying the invariant.
  - **During iterations:** The operations either increment `x` or `y` or do not decrease them, ensuring they remain non-negative.
  - **At termination:** If the loop exits, `x` will be at least 0, and if `x >= 4`, then `y` will have been modified in such a way that the post-condition is satisfied.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
- The invariant `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` is established at the beginning of the loop since both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, satisfying the condition.

**Pre-condition Guarantee:**
- The initialization of `x` and `y` to 0 guarantees that the invariant holds true before the first iteration of the loop.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
- The invariant is preserved through the iterations because:
  - In the first `if` block, `x` is incremented, and `y` is incremented by 2, both maintaining non-negativity.
  - In the second `if` block, `y` is negated, but since it is checked against conditions that involve `w` and `z`, it is ensured that `y` will remain non-negative or revert to a positive value in subsequent iterations.
  - In the `else` block, both `x` and `y` are incremented, ensuring they remain non-negative.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables Upon Termination:**
- When the loop terminates, we know that `unknown()` is false. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` will depend on how many iterations were executed, but we can state:
  - `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` will still hold true.

**Why the Loop Invariant Remains Valid:**
- The invariant remains valid because the loop's exit condition does not violate the non-negativity of `x` and `y`. Thus, upon termination, the invariant continues to hold.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);` is correct as long as the invariant is maintained.

**How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
- If the loop terminates and `x >= 4`, we have established through the loop's operations that `y` must have been updated sufficiently to satisfy `y > 2`. Thus, the invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (i.e., `unknown()` being false), confirms that the post-condition holds true.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 23:06:29,945 - DEBUG  - regen reasoning
2025-12-23 23:06:29,946 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (line 21)**
   - The invariant `y >= 0` fails to hold after iterations. Since `y` can be negated in the second `if` statement (`y = 0 - y`), this can lead to `y` being negative. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to account for the possibility of `y` becoming negative during loop iterations.

2. **Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (line 24)**
   - The invariant `(x + 2 * (w + 1) >= y) || (y == 0)` is not preserved after each iteration. The operations in the loop can modify `y` in such a way that this invariant does not hold. The relationship between `x`, `w`, and `y` must be re-evaluated to ensure it holds true after each iteration.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion (line 45)**
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified because the loop invariant does not sufficiently strengthen the relationship between `x` and `y` when the loop terminates. The invariant must be modified to ensure that it can imply this assertion when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo187() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;

2025-12-23 23:22:35,831 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo187` is to perform a series of operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` while the condition defined by `unknown()` is true. The loop modifies these variables based on their current values, and the intended outcome seems to be to adjust `y` based on the relationship between `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` over a series of iterations.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues to execute as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations Performed:**
  - If `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 2.
  - If `y` is greater than `10 * w` and `z` is greater than or equal to `100 * x`, `y` is negated.
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 100.
  - Regardless of the conditions, `w` is incremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 10 at the end of each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `x < 4`, `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - If `x < 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.
3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - If `x < 4`, `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`.
4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - If `x < 4`, `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`.
5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - If `x >= 4`, `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates after the fifth iteration, final values could be: `x = 5`, `y = 402`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The verification goal is the assertion: `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);`.

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as an Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal is only true at termination, specifically when `x >= 4` is true, which may not hold during all iterations.

**Modification to Create a Valid Invariant:**
To create a valid invariant, we could modify the goal to: 
- **Invariant:** `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.

**Justification for the Modified Invariant:**
- **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are all initialized to 0, thus `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` holds true.
- **Preservation:** At each iteration, `x` and `y` are either incremented or set to a non-negative value, ensuring they remain non-negative.
- **Termination:** Upon termination, the loop invariant holds, and since `x >= 4` implies `y > 2` is part of the final state, the invariant supports the verification goal.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.

**Validity Explanation:**
This invariant is valid because:
- It is established at the start with `x = 0` and `y = 0`.
- It is preserved through the loop iterations as `x` and `y` are always incremented or set to non-negative values.
- It holds true at termination since the variables maintain non-negativity throughout.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
At the start of the loop, all variables are initialized to 0, satisfying the invariant `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.

**Pre-condition Guarantee:**
The initialization of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` to 0 guarantees that both parts of the invariant hold before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
At the start of each iteration:
- If `x >= 4`, `x` is incremented, thus remaining non-negative, and `y` is increased by 2, ensuring `y >= 0`.
- If `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`, `y` is negated but remains non-negative as `y` was initially set to a non-negative value.
- In the else case, both `x` and `y` are incremented, preserving the non-negativity.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables Upon Termination:**
When the loop terminates, the state of the variables could be `x >= 4`, `y`, `z`, and `w` will be non-negative.

**Invariant Validity Under Termination:**
The invariant `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` holds true when the loop condition becomes false, ensuring that all variables are in a valid state.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Post-condition:**
The post-condition `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);` is correct because if the loop terminates with `x >= 4`, it must imply that `y` has been sufficiently incremented through the iterations.

**How the Invariant and Negation of the Loop Condition Proves the Post-condition:**
If `x >= 4` holds upon termination, then based on the loop's operations and the nature of the increments, `y` must also be greater than 2, satisfying the post-condition. Thus, the loop invariant supports the assertion, confirming its correctness.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.

2025-12-23 23:26:44,400 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:
The errors indicate that both the goal preservation and the goal assertion are not being satisfied by the current loop invariants. 

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The invariant `y >= 0` fails preservation because the loop body can set `y` to a negative value when the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true. This negation means that `y` can become negative, violating the invariant.

2. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` is not being satisfied because the relationship between `x` and `y` is not sufficiently captured in the invariants. The existing invariant `(x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2)` does not guarantee that `y` will indeed be greater than 2 when `x` reaches 4, especially considering the operations on `y` within the loop.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we need to ensure:
- The invariants correctly establish the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` before entering the loop and maintain their relationships throughout the iterations.
- The invariants must imply the post-condition when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

### Fixed C Code:

      loop invariant (y >= 0) ==> (y <= 100 * (w + 1)); // Ensure y does not exceed expected bounds

2025-12-23 23:38:44,308 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**  
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo187` is to execute a series of operations based on the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, while the condition provided by the function `unknown()` is true. The loop appears to be manipulating these variables in a way that depends on their current states, particularly `x`, `y`, and `z`, to determine how they are updated.

**Structure:**  
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues executing as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations Performed in the Body:**
  - If `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 2.
  - If `y` is greater than `10 * w` and `z` is greater than or equal to `100 * x`, `y` is set to its negative value.
  - Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 100.
  - After any of these conditions, `w` is incremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 10.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: A counter that affects the behavior of the loop.
  - `y`: Another counter that can change based on the conditions in the loop.
  - `z`: A variable that increases steadily and influences the second conditional.
  - `w`: A counter that increments with each iteration and is used in one of the conditions.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - Condition: `unknown()` is true.
   - Execution: `x` increments to 1, `y` increments to 100 (else clause).
   - Values: `x = 1`, `y = 100`, `z = 10`, `w = 1`.

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - Condition: `unknown()` is true.
   - Execution: `x` increments to 2, `y` increments to 100 (else clause).
   - Values: `x = 2`, `y = 200`, `z = 20`, `w = 2`.

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - Condition: `unknown()` is true.
   - Execution: `x` increments to 3, `y` increments to 100 (else clause).
   - Values: `x = 3`, `y = 300`, `z = 30`, `w = 3`.

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - Condition: `unknown()` is true.
   - Execution: `x` increments to 4, `y` increments to 100 (else clause).
   - Values: `x = 4`, `y = 400`, `z = 40`, `w = 4`.

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - Condition: `unknown()` is true.
   - Execution: `x` increments to 5, `y` increments to 100 (else clause).
   - Values: `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If `unknown()` becomes false after the fifth iteration, the final values would be `x = 5`, `y = 500`, `z = 50`, `w = 5`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**  
The provided post-condition is `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);`. This means if `x` is at least 4 when the loop terminates, then `y` must be greater than 2.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**  
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because it is only true at termination and not necessarily during the iterations of the loop.

**Modification to create a valid invariant:**
To create a suitable invariant, we can state:
- Invariant: `x >= 0 && y >= 0 && z >= 0 && w >= 0`
This can be modified further to include conditions based on the loop behavior:
- A more specific invariant could be `x >= 0 && y >= 100 * w && z >= 10 * w`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**  
`x >= 0 && y >= 100 * w && z >= 10 * w`

**Explanation of Validity:**  
- This invariant holds true because:
  - Initially, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are all initialized to 0, satisfying the invariant.
  - Throughout the iterations, `x` increases by at least 1, `y` increases by 100, and `z` increases by 10, ensuring that `y` and `z` maintain their relationships to `w`.

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**  
Before the first iteration, all variables are initialized to 0, thus:
- `x >= 0` is true.
- `y >= 100 * w` (0 >= 0) is true.
- `z >= 10 * w` (0 >= 0) is true.
Therefore, the invariant holds before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**  
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration:
  - If `x >= 4`, `x` is incremented by 1, `y` by 2 (preserving the relationship as `y` is already significantly larger than `100 * w`).
  - If `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`, `y` becomes negative, but since `w` increments, `y` still maintains a relationship as it is reset to a negative value.
  - In the else case, both `x` and `y` increase, preserving the invariant.
  
In each case, the invariant remains true after the iteration.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables Upon Termination:**  
When the loop terminates, `unknown()` is false. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` depend on the number of iterations executed but will generally maintain:
- `x >= 0`
- `y` could be large, depending on how many times it was incremented.
- `z` also increases steadily.
- `w` reflects the number of iterations.

**Why the Invariant Remains Valid:**  
At termination, since `w` reflects the number of iterations, the relationships between `y`, `z`, and `w` hold, ensuring the invariant is still valid.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**  
The post-condition `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);` is correct as long as the loop executed enough iterations to allow `x` to reach at least 4, which it does based on the loop's behavior. 

**Proof with Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:**  
When the loop terminates, if `x >= 4`, then through the invariant and the operations within the loop, `y` must have increased sufficiently (greater than `100 * w`, which would always be greater than 2 after multiple iterations). Thus, the post-condition is satisfied.

2025-12-23 23:38:44,338 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

2025-12-23 23:39:28,039 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0)**:
   - The invariant `y >= 0` fails to be preserved because `y` can be set to `0 - y` in the second conditional when `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x`. This operation can lead to `y` becoming negative, violating the invariant.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 100 * w)**:
   - The invariant `y >= 100 * w` also fails to be preserved. After incrementing `y` by 100 in the else clause, `y` could become larger than `100 * w`, but it can also be reset to a negative value in the second conditional. Thus, this invariant does not hold through all iterations.

3. **Goal Assertion (assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2))**:
   - The assertion cannot be verified because the invariants do not sufficiently constrain the values of `y` when `x >= 4`. If `y` can be negative or not sufficiently large, the assertion fails. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be implied when the loop condition becomes false.

2025-12-23 23:41:37,007 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 4) ==> (y >= 100 * (x - 4) + 2)**:
   - The invariant fails to be preserved because when `x` is incremented in the loop, the condition `(x >= 4)` may not hold after the increment. If `y` is set to a negative value in the second conditional (`y = 0 - y`), it could violate the invariant in the next iteration. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure it holds true throughout all iterations.

2. **Goal Assertion (assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2))**:
   - The assertion cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently constrain the relationship between `x` and `y` when `x` is at least 4. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when the loop terminates, `y` is guaranteed to be greater than 2 if `x` is 4 or more.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we will ensure that:
- `y` has a minimum value that guarantees the postcondition when `x >= 4`.
- The invariants should maintain their validity after each iteration.

2025-12-23 23:56:36,099 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo187` is to perform a series of updates on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the results of the `unknown()` function, which determines whether the loop continues executing. The intended outcome seems to involve manipulating these variables based on their current values, specifically affecting `x` and `y` under certain conditions while incrementing `w` and `z` on every iteration.

The loop's governing condition is `while(unknown())`, which means the loop will continue executing as long as the `unknown()` function returns true. Inside the loop, there are three conditional branches:

1. If `x >= 4`, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
2. If `y > 10 * w` and `z >= 100 * x`, negate `y`.
3. Otherwise, increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.

The variables relevant to its behavior are:
- `x`: Influences the first conditional branch.
- `y`: Influences the second conditional branch and is modified in both the first and third branches.
- `z`: Affects the second conditional branch.
- `w`: Affects the second conditional branch and is incremented in every iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

#### Pre-Loop Sampling
Before the loop begins:
- `x = 0`
- `y = 0`
- `z = 0`
- `w = 0`

#### Post-Iteration Sampling
Assuming the loop executes at least five times, we will sample the variable values after each iteration. The actual values depend on the return value of `unknown()` and the conditions.

1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `x < 4`, then:
     - `x = 1`
     - `y = 100`
     - `z = 10`
     - `w = 1`
   - If `x >= 4`, then:
     - `x = 1`
     - `y = 2`
     - `z = 10`
     - `w = 1`
  
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - Continuing from above, if `x < 4`:
     - `x = 2`
     - `y = 200`
     - `z = 20`
     - `w = 2`
   - If `x >= 4`:
     - `x = 2`
     - `y = 4`
     - `z = 20`
     - `w = 2`

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - Continuing from above, if `x < 4`:
     - `x = 3`
     - `y = 300`
     - `z = 30`
     - `w = 3`
   - If `x >= 4`:
     - `x = 3`
     - `y = 6`
     - `z = 30`
     - `w = 3`

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - Continuing from above, if `x < 4`:
     - `x = 4`
     - `y = 400`
     - `z = 40`
     - `w = 4`
   - If `x >= 4`:
     - `x = 4`
     - `y = 8`
     - `z = 40`
     - `w = 4`

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - Continuing from above, if `x < 4`:
     - `x = 5`
     - `y = 500`
     - `z = 50`
     - `w = 5`
   - If `x >= 4`:
     - `x = 5`
     - `y = 10`
     - `z = 50`
     - `w = 5`

#### Post-Loop Sampling
If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, we would sample the final values. However, since the loop condition depends on `unknown()`, we cannot definitively state these values without knowing the outcome of `unknown()`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal is the assertion provided at the end of the function: `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);`.

#### Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?
**NO**: The verification goal is only true at termination (when the loop condition is false). It does not hold during the iterations, as `x` and `y` may not satisfy this condition until the loop completes.

#### Modifying the Verification Goal
To create a valid invariant, we could consider a modified invariant:
- **Invariant**: `x >= 0 && y >= 0`.

**Establishment**: This holds before the first iteration since `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are initialized to 0.

**Preservation**: Throughout the iterations, both `x` and `y` are incremented or manipulated, but they will remain non-negative.

**Termination**: Upon termination, if `x >= 4`, then `y` must be greater than 2 (from the post-condition), thus the invariant is maintained.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

The proposed loop invariant is:
- **Invariant**: `x >= 0 && y >= 0`.

This invariant is valid because:
- It holds true at the start of the loop (establishment).
- The operations within the loop do not allow `x` or `y` to become negative (preservation).
- When the loop terminates, the conditions for `x` and `y` ensure the invariant is still valid (termination).

### e. Establishment

The invariant `x >= 0 && y >= 0` is established as follows:
- Before the loop starts, all variables are initialized to 0. Therefore, both `x` and `y` satisfy the invariant condition (`0 >= 0` is true).

### f. Preservation

To show preservation:
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`x >= 0 && y >= 0`), we analyze the body of the loop:
  - In the first branch, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` by 2, both remain non-negative.
  - In the second branch, `y` is negated, but since it is always non-negative, this branch does not violate the invariant.
  - In the third branch, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` by 100, which keeps both non-negative.
- Thus, if the invariant holds at the start of an iteration, it holds at the end.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` becomes false. At this point, we need to evaluate:
- The state of the variables. If the loop terminates, `x` is either less than or equal to 4, and `y` must be non-negative. The invariant `x >= 0 && y >= 0` still holds true.
- The loop invariant is valid under these conditions, and we can conclude that it remains true upon termination.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2);` is correct under the conditions that if `x` is indeed greater than or equal to 4, then `y` must also be greater than 2, which can be derived from the operations performed in the loop.

The invariant `x >= 0 && y >= 0` combined with the negation of the loop condition (when the loop exits) implies that the loop has maintained the integrity of the variable states throughout its execution, thus proving that the post-condition is satisfied.

2025-12-23 23:56:36,128 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo187() {

    int x;

2025-12-23 23:57:20,355 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The current invariant `y >= 0` fails to hold after the iterations due to the operation `y = 0 - y;` in the second conditional branch. This operation can lead to `y` becoming negative, thus violating the invariant. Therefore, the invariant needs to be adjusted to account for the potential change in the value of `y` during the loop execution.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the existing invariants. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that when `x` is greater than or equal to 4, it guarantees that `y` will also be greater than 2 at the termination of the loop. This requires establishing a relationship between `x` and `y` that holds throughout the loop iterations.

### Fixed C Code:

In the loop, if the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true, `y` is set to `0 - y`, which can lead to `y` being negative. This operation violates the invariant as it breaks the relationship between `x` and `y`. Therefore, the invariant needs to be adjusted to account for the fact that `y` can change significantly during the loop.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when `x` is at least 4, `y` must also be greater than 2 at the end of the loop. This requires establishing a more robust relationship between `x` and `y` that holds throughout the loop.

   - The invariant `(x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2)` is not preserved during the iterations of the loop. Specifically, if the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true, the operation `y = 0 - y` can lead to `y` becoming negative. This breaks the invariant as it allows `y` to fall below the required threshold, thus violating the preservation condition.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the existing invariants. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when `x` is at least 4, `y` must also be greater than 2 at the end of the loop. This requires establishing a more robust relationship between `x` and `y` that holds throughout the loop iterations.

To address these issues, the loop invariants need to be redefined to ensure they hold throughout the loop and adequately support the assertion.

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The invariant `(x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2)` fails to be preserved during the loop iterations. Specifically, if the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true, the operation `y = 0 - y` can lead to `y` becoming negative. This breaks the invariant, as it allows `y` to fall below the required threshold when `x` is at least 4.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the current invariants. To strengthen the invariant, we need to ensure that when `x` is at least 4, `y` must also be greater than 2 at the end of the loop. This requires establishing a more robust relationship between `x` and `y` that holds throughout the loop iterations.

To address these issues, the loop invariants need to be redefined to ensure they hold throughout the loop and adequately support the assertion.

2025-12-24 00:06:46,194 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The invariant `(x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2)` is not preserved during the loop iterations. Specifically, if the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true, the operation `y = 0 - y` can lead to `y` becoming negative. This violates the invariant since it allows `y` to fall below the required threshold when `x` is at least 4.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when `x` is at least 4, `y` must also be greater than 2 at the end of the loop. This requires establishing a more robust relationship between `x` and `y` that holds throughout the loop iterations.

To address these issues, the loop invariants need to be redefined to ensure they hold throughout the loop and adequately support the assertion.

2025-12-24 00:08:30,736 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**:
   - The invariant `(x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2)` is not preserved during the loop iterations. Specifically, if the condition `y > 10 * w && z >= 100 * x` is true, the operation `y = 0 - y` can lead to `y` becoming negative. This violates the invariant because it allows `y` to fall below the required threshold when `x` is at least 4.

2. **Goal Assertion**:
   - The assertion `/*@ assert (x >= 4) ==> (y > 2); */` cannot be verified with the current invariants. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when `x` is at least 4, `y` must also be greater than 2 at the end of the loop. This requires establishing a more robust relationship between `x` and `y` that holds throughout the loop iterations.

To address these issues, the loop invariants need to be redefined to ensure they hold throughout the loop and adequately support the assertion.
