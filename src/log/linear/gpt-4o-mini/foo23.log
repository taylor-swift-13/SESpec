#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo23` is to increment the variable `i` by 2 and decrement the variable `j` by 1 until `j` is no longer greater than or equal to `i`. The intended outcome is to modify `i` and `j` such that the loop eventually terminates when `j` becomes less than `i`.

The loop's structure is governed by the condition `while (j >= i)`. Inside the loop, two operations are performed:
1. `i = i + 2`: This increases the value of `i` by 2 in each iteration.
2. `j = j - 1`: This decreases the value of `j` by 1 in each iteration.

The relevant variables for the loop's behavior are:
- `i`: starts at 1 and increases by 2 in each iteration.
- `j`: starts at 20 and decreases by 1 in each iteration.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Before the loop starts: `i = 1`, `j = 20`.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  - After iteration 1: `i = 3`, `j = 19`.
  - After iteration 2: `i = 5`, `j = 18`.
  - After iteration 3: `i = 7`, `j = 17`.
  - After iteration 4: `i = 9`, `j = 16`.
  - After iteration 5: `i = 11`, `j = 15`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - After iteration 6: `i = 13`, `j = 14`. (Loop terminates since `j < i`).

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The post-condition we need to prove is `assert j == 13;`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal `j == 13` is only true when the loop has terminated and does not hold during the iterations of the loop.

- **Modification of the verification goal:**
  To create a valid invariant, we can modify the verification goal to track the relationship between `i` and `j` throughout the loop. A suitable invariant could be: 
  - `j = 20 - (i - 1) / 2`.

  This modified invariant implies:
  - **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `i = 1` and `j = 20`, so `20 - (1 - 1) / 2 = 20`, which is true.
  - **Preservation:** If `j >= i` holds, then after one iteration, `i` becomes `i + 2` and `j` becomes `j - 1`, which maintains the relationship.
  - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, `j < i`, and thus the invariant can be used to derive that `j` must equal 13 when the loop condition fails.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration, `j = 20 - (i - 1) / 2`.

- **Explanation of Validity:** 
  - This invariant holds true at the beginning and end of every iteration because it reflects the consistent decrement of `j` and the increment of `i`. The relationship is preserved as both `i` and `j` are modified in a predictable manner that maintains this equality.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant:**
  - The invariant `j = 20 - (i - 1) / 2` holds before the first iteration because `i = 1` and `j = 20`, leading to `20 - (1 - 1) / 2 = 20`.

- **Pre-condition guarantee:** The initialization of `i` and `j` ensures that the invariant holds before the loop begins.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant:**
  - If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`j = 20 - (i - 1) / 2`) and the loop condition `j >= i` is true, then at the end of the iteration:
    - `i` is updated to `i + 2`, and `j` is updated to `j - 1`.
    - We need to show that `j - 1 = 20 - (i + 2 - 1) / 2`.
    - This simplifies to `j - 1 = 20 - (i + 1) / 2`, which maintains the invariant.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when `j < i`. At this point, `i = 13` and `j = 14`, thus the invariant still holds.

- **Validity of the Invariant:** The invariant remains valid because it accurately describes the relationship between `i` and `j` even at termination.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-condition:** The post-condition `assert j == 13;` is incorrect because upon termination `j` is actually `14`, not `13`.

- **Proof with Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition:** 
  - The invariant suggests that when the loop condition fails (`j < i`), we can derive that `j` must be `14` (not `13`). Thus, the provided post-condition does not hold true based on the established invariant. 

### Conclusion
The loop invariant is valid, but the provided post-condition does not hold true based on the behavior of the loop. The correct relationship between `i` and `j` must be carefully considered when evaluating post-conditions.
