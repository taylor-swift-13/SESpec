2025-12-24 07:17:02,373 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the `foo75` function is to increment the variable `z` while keeping track of the number of increments with the variable `c`. The loop continues until the condition defined by the function `unknown()` becomes false. The loop's intended outcome is to ensure that `z` is incremented a maximum of 36 times, as controlled by the variable `c`.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop is governed by the condition `while (unknown())`, which continues to execute as long as `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:** Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks if `c < 36`. If true, `z` is incremented by 1 and `c` is also incremented by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `c`: A counter that tracks the number of times `z` has been incremented, initialized to 0.
  - `z`: A variable that is incremented in the loop, initialized to `36 * y`.
  - `y`: An input parameter constrained between 0 and 127, influencing the initial value of `z`.
  - `x1`, `x2`, `x3`: Additional input parameters that are not used within the loop but are part of the function signature.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop starts:
  - `c = 0`
  - `z = 36 * y` (with `0 <= y <= 127`, thus `z` can range from `0` to `4572`)

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
- After 1st iteration:
  - If `c < 36` is true: 
    - `c = 1`
    - `z = 36 * y + 1`
- After 2nd iteration:
  - If `c < 36` is true: 
    - `c = 2`
    - `z = 36 * y + 2`
- After 3rd iteration:
  - If `c < 36` is true: 
    - `c = 3`
    - `z = 36 * y + 3`
- After 4th iteration:
  - If `c < 36` is true: 
    - `c = 4`
    - `z = 36 * y + 4`
- After 5th iteration:
  - If `c < 36` is true: 
    - `c = 5`
    - `z = 36 * y + 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates after 5 iterations, then:
  - `c = 5`
  - `z = 36 * y + 5`
- If the loop terminates after 36 iterations, then:
  - `c = 36`
  - `z = 36 * y + 36`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The verification goal is the post-condition: `assert (c < 36) ==> (z >= 0);`

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as a loop invariant because it only holds true at termination (when `c` reaches 36 or the loop condition fails) and not during iterations.

**Modifying the Verification Goal:**
To create a valid invariant, we can modify it to: 
- `c < 36 ==> z >= 36 * y + c;`
This modified invariant states that if `c` is less than 36, then `z` must be at least `36 * y + c`.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`c < 36 ==> z >= 36 * y + c;`

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant is valid because:
1. **Establishment:** Before the loop starts, `c` is initialized to 0, and `z` is initialized to `36 * y`, satisfying the invariant since `0 < 36` implies `z >= 36 * y + 0`.
2. **Preservation:** If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration, and if `c < 36`, then upon executing the loop body, both `c` and `z` are incremented by 1. Therefore, `z` will still satisfy the condition `z >= 36 * y + c + 1`.
3. **Termination:** When the loop terminates, if `c` reaches 36, the invariant holds vacuously since the implication is true when the premise is false.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment Explanation:**
The proposed invariant `c < 36 ==> z >= 36 * y + c` is established before the first iteration because:
- At the start, `c = 0` and `z = 36 * y`. 
- The condition `0 < 36` is true, and `z = 36 * y >= 36 * y + 0`, confirming the invariant holds before the first iteration.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation Explanation:**
The invariant is preserved during each iteration:
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (`c < 36` implies `z >= 36 * y + c`), and if the loop condition is true, then:
  - `c` is incremented by 1 (now `c + 1`).
  - `z` is also incremented by 1 (now `z + 1`).
- The new state becomes:
  - `c + 1 < 36` (still true if `c < 36`).
  - We have `z + 1 >= 36 * y + c`, which implies `z >= 36 * y + (c + 1)`.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**
When the loop terminates, it could be because `unknown()` returns false or `c` reaches 36. If the loop terminates:
- If `c < 36`, then `z >= 36 * y + c` still holds.
- If `c = 36`, the invariant holds vacuously.

**Why the Invariant Remains Valid:**
The invariant remains valid upon termination because if the loop condition is false, the implication holds, thus satisfying the post-condition.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
The post-condition `assert (c < 36) ==> (z >= 0);` is correct because:
- If `c < 36`, then from our invariant, we have `z >= 36 * y + c`, and since `0 <= y <= 127`, `z` is guaranteed to be non-negative.

**How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
The invariant, when combined with the negation of the loop condition (indicating the loop has terminated), confirms that `c < 36` implies `z >= 0`, thus proving the post-condition is met.

Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `0 <= \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 127 && (z == 36 * \at(y,Pre)) * (c == 0) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre)) * (x1 == \at(x1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires 0 <= y && y <= 127;
    */
    
void foo75(int y,int x1,int x2,int x3) {
  int c = 0;
  int z = 36 * y;
  

  
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_c ;

          loop invariant x3 == \at(x3,Pre);
          loop invariant x2 == \at(x2,Pre);
          loop invariant x1 == \at(x1,Pre);
          loop invariant y == \at(y,Pre);
            */
            while (unknown()) {

    if ( c < 36 )
    {
    z  = z + 1;
    c  = c + 1;
    }
  }
            
    /*@ assert  ( c < 36 ) ==> ( z >= 0 ) ; */
      
  
}`
