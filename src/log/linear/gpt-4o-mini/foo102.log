#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The purpose of the loop in the function `foo102` is to increment the variable `x` from its initial value of `0` until it reaches the value of `n`. This effectively counts from `0` to `n - 1`, ensuring that `x` equals `n` when the loop terminates.
  
- **Structure**: 
  - The loop is governed by the condition `while (x < n)`, meaning it will continue executing as long as `x` is less than `n`.
  - Inside the loop body, the operation performed is `x = (x + 1)`, which increments `x` by `1` on each iteration.
  - The relevant variable is `x`, which starts at `0` and is incremented in each iteration until it is no longer less than `n`.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Before the loop begins: `x = 0`, `n` is a non-negative integer.

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After 1st iteration: `x = 1`
  - After 2nd iteration: `x = 2`
  - After 3rd iteration: `x = 3`
  - After 4th iteration: `x = 4`
  - After 5th iteration: `x = 5` (if `n >= 5`)

- **Post-Loop Sampling** (if applicable):
  - If `n = 5`, upon exiting the loop: `x = 5` (loop terminates as `x < n` is false).

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition to be proven is `assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == n);`. This means if `n` is non-negative, then `x` must equal `n` when the loop terminates.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal is only true at termination (when the loop exits) and not necessarily during the iterations. Thus, it cannot be used directly as a loop invariant.

- **Modification for a valid invariant**:
  - We can modify the verification goal to state: "At the start of each iteration, `x` is less than or equal to `n`." This can be established as an invariant.
  
  - **Establishment**: Initially, `x = 0`, which is less than or equal to any non-negative `n`.
  - **Preservation**: If `x <= n` at the start of an iteration and `x < n` holds, after the increment `x` will still be less than or equal to `n` until it reaches `n`.
  - **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` will equal `n`, satisfying the original verification goal.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: "At the beginning of each iteration, `x` is less than or equal to `n`."
  
- **Validity Explanation**: This invariant is valid because:
  - It is true before the loop starts (since `x = 0` and `n >= 0`).
  - It is preserved through each iteration since incrementing `x` does not violate the condition until `x` equals `n`.
  - Upon termination, the invariant holds that `x = n`, thus satisfying the post-condition.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant**: The invariant holds before the first iteration because `x` is initialized to `0`, and since `n` is non-negative, `0 <= n` holds true.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant**: If the invariant holds at the start of an iteration (i.e., `x <= n`), and the loop condition `x < n` is true, then after the operation `x = (x + 1)`, `x` will be incremented by `1`. Thus, it will still be less than or equal to `n` until `x` reaches `n`.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables on Termination**: When the loop terminates, `x` is equal to `n` (i.e., `x == n`), which means the loop condition `x < n` is false.

- **Validity of the Invariant at Termination**: The invariant `x <= n` is valid upon termination because `x` equals `n`, thus maintaining the invariant condition.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-condition**: The provided post-condition `assert (n >= 0) ==> (x == n);` is correct.

- **Proof of Post-condition**: The invariant `x <= n` combined with the negation of the loop condition (which is `x < n` is false) implies that `x` must equal `n` when the loop exits. Therefore, the post-condition is satisfied.

Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.

- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.
