#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo84` is to repeatedly add the value of `y` to `x` while `x` is negative. The intended outcome is to modify `x` until it is no longer negative, which implies that `y` will have increased sufficiently to achieve this.

- **Governing Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x < 0`.
- **Operations in Loop Body**:
  - `x = x + y;`: This operation increases `x` by the current value of `y`.
  - `y = y + 1;`: This operation increments `y` by 1 for the next iteration.
  
- **Relevant Variables**:
  - `x`: Starts at -50 and is modified by adding `y`.
  - `y`: Starts at the input value and is incremented with each iteration.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - `x = -50`
  - `y = <input_value>`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - **Iteration 1**:
    - `x = -50 + y`
    - `y = <input_value> + 1`
  - **Iteration 2**:
    - `x = (-50 + y) + (y + 1) = -50 + 2y + 1`
    - `y = <input_value> + 2`
  - **Iteration 3**:
    - `x = (-50 + 2y + 1) + (y + 2) = -50 + 3y + 3`
    - `y = <input_value> + 3`
  - **Iteration 4**:
    - `x = (-50 + 3y + 3) + (y + 3) = -50 + 4y + 6`
    - `y = <input_value> + 4`
  - **Iteration 5**:
    - `x = (-50 + 4y + 6) + (y + 4) = -50 + 5y + 10`
    - `y = <input_value> + 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - The loop terminates when `x >= 0`. The exact state of `x` and `y` at termination will depend on the input value.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The post-condition is `assert(y > 0);`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it only holds true upon termination of the loop and not necessarily during each iteration.

- **Modification for Invariant**: 
  - We can modify the verification goal to `y >= 0` as a potential invariant. This holds true before the loop starts and is maintained through iterations since `y` starts from the input value and is incremented.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `y >= 0`.

- **Explanation of Validity**:
  - Before the loop starts, `y` is the input value, which is presumably non-negative. During each iteration, `y` is incremented, thus maintaining `y >= 0` throughout the loop.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of Invariant**:
  - The invariant `y >= 0` is established since `y` is initialized with the input value, which is assumed to be non-negative.

- **Pre-condition Guarantee**:
  - The input value of `y` is not specified to be negative, hence it guarantees that `y` starts at a non-negative value.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of Invariant**:
  - If `y >= 0` holds at the start of an iteration and the loop condition `x < 0` is true, then:
    - After the operation `y = y + 1`, `y` will still be non-negative because it was non-negative to start with.
  - Therefore, `y >= 0` is preserved through each iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State at Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `x >= 0`. At this point, `x` has been incremented by the increasing values of `y`, and `y` has been incremented several times.

- **Invariant Validity at Termination**:
  - Since `y` was non-negative and has been incremented, `y` remains non-negative at termination, thus `y >= 0` is still valid.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: 
  - The post-condition `assert(y > 0);` can be correct if the input value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0, as it is incremented in each iteration.

- **Proof of Post-condition**:
  - The invariant `y >= 0` combined with the termination condition (`x >= 0`) implies that `y` has been incremented sufficiently. Therefore, if `y` started from a non-negative value and has been incremented, it must hold that `y > 0` upon loop termination, thus satisfying the post-condition. 

In conclusion, the loop invariant `y >= 0` is valid and helps in proving the correctness of the post-condition `assert(y > 0);` under the assumption that the input value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

2025-12-24 00:15:46,407 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### Loop Verification Analysis

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo84` is to incrementally adjust the value of `x` by adding `y` to it until `x` is no longer less than zero. The intended outcome is to modify the variables `x` and `y` such that `x` eventually becomes non-negative.

The loop's structure is defined by the condition `while (x < 0)`, which means that the loop will continue executing as long as `x` is negative. Inside the loop, two operations are performed:
1. `x = x + y;` - This operation increases `x` by the current value of `y`.
2. `y = y + 1;` - This operation increments `y` by 1.

The relevant variables are:
- `x`: Initialized to -50 and modified during the loop.
- `y`: Passed as a parameter and modified during the loop.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - Initial values: `x = -50`, `y = <initial_value>`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  1. After 1st iteration:
     - `x = -50 + y` (new value)
     - `y = <initial_value> + 1`
  2. After 2nd iteration:
     - `x = (-50 + y) + (y + 1) = -50 + 2y + 1`
     - `y = <initial_value> + 2`
  3. After 3rd iteration:
     - `x = (-50 + 2y + 1) + (y + 2) = -50 + 3y + 3`
     - `y = <initial_value> + 3`
  4. After 4th iteration:
     - `x = (-50 + 3y + 3) + (y + 3) = -50 + 4y + 6`
     - `y = <initial_value> + 4`
  5. After 5th iteration:
     - `x = (-50 + 4y + 6) + (y + 4) = -50 + 5y + 10`
     - `y = <initial_value> + 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling:**
  - The loop terminates when `x >= 0`. This will happen when:
    \[
    -50 + ny + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \geq 0
    \]
    for some integer `n` (the number of iterations).

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The post-condition states `assert y > 0;`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal `y > 0` is not true during all iterations; it only holds true at termination when the loop condition is false.

- **Modification to create a valid invariant:**
  - A suitable invariant could be `y >= 0` at the start of the loop and `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, ensuring it remains non-negative.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** `y >= 0`.

- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - This invariant is valid because `y` starts from its initial value (which is positive or zero), and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Thus, it will always be greater than or equal to zero throughout the loop.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant:**
  - Before the first iteration, `y` is the initial value passed to the function. Assuming `y` starts from a non-negative integer, `y >= 0` holds true.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant:**
  - If `y >= 0` holds at the beginning of an iteration, then after executing `y = y + 1;`, `y` will still be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the invariant is preserved through each iteration.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when `x >= 0`. At this point, `y` has been incremented `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations. Thus, `y = <initial_value> + n`.

- **Validity of Invariant at Termination:**
  - Since `y` is incremented with each iteration, it will still hold that `y >= 0` when the loop terminates.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-condition:**
  - The provided post-condition `assert y > 0;` is not necessarily correct unless the initial value of `y` was strictly greater than zero.

- **How the invariant proves the post-condition:**
  - The invariant `y >= 0` combined with the loop's termination condition (`x >= 0`) does not directly imply `y > 0`. The assertion will only hold true if the initial value of `y` was greater than 0. If `y` started at 0, the post-condition would fail. Thus, the function does not guarantee that `y > 0` upon termination unless additional constraints are placed on the input.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_y ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }`

2025-12-24 00:17:08,580 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the current loop invariant is fundamentally incorrect. The following issues need to be addressed:

1. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `/*@ assert y > 0; */` cannot be verified because the loop invariant does not ensure that `y` is positive when the loop terminates. This means we need to establish a stronger invariant that directly relates to `y` being greater than zero.

2. **Goal Establishment of Invariant**: The precondition must provide sufficient constraints to establish the loop invariant before the loop starts. Currently, there is no invariant that guarantees that `y` will be positive after the loop.

3. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The loop body modifies `y` but does not ensure that `y` remains positive throughout the iterations. We need to create an invariant that guarantees `y` is incremented in such a way that it stays positive.

To address these issues, we will regenerate the loop invariant to ensure that it meets the criteria for establishment, preservation, and termination. The new invariant will need to reflect the initial state and the changes made in each iteration.

### Fixed C Code:
```c
void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;

    /*@
      loop invariant x == -50 + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * (\at(y, Pre) >= 0 ? 1 : 0);
      loop invariant y >= \at(y, Pre);
      loop assigns x, y;

        x  = x + y;
        y  = y + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert y > 0; */

2025-12-24 00:23:41,635 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors indicate that the current loop invariant `y == \at(y, Pre) + (\at(y, Pre) - y)` is fundamentally flawed. This invariant does not hold true at the beginning of the loop and does not remain valid after each iteration. 

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The invariant fails to account for how `y` is modified within the loop. Since `y` is incremented in each iteration (`y = y + 1`), the invariant must reflect this change and ensure that it remains valid throughout the loop's execution.

2. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `/*@ assert y > 0; */` cannot be verified with the current invariant because it does not guarantee that `y` will be greater than zero at the end of the loop. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that `y` is positive when the loop terminates.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we will create conditions that reflect the initial state of `y`, ensure that `y` remains positive throughout the loop, and account for the increments made to `y`.

### Fixed C Code:
```c
void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;

    /*@
      loop invariant y >= \at(y, Pre);
      loop invariant y > 0;
      loop assigns x, y;
    */
    while (x < 0) {
        x  = x + y;
        y  = y + 1;
    }
    
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
}

2025-12-24 00:30:41,999 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo84` is to repeatedly add the value of `y` to `x` while `x` is negative. The intended outcome is to transform `x` from a negative value to a non-negative value by continuously incrementing it with `y`, which is also incremented in each iteration.

The loop's structure consists of the following components:
- **Governing Condition:** `while (x < 0)` - The loop continues as long as `x` is less than 0.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:**
  - `x = x + y;` - This operation increases `x` by the current value of `y`.
  - `y = y + 1;` - This operation increments `y` by 1 for the next iteration.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: Initially set to -50. It is modified in each iteration to eventually become non-negative.
  - `y`: Passed as a parameter to the function and incremented in each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values before the loop starts:
  - `x = -50`
  - `y = <initial value>`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - `x = -50 + y`
   - `y = <initial value> + 1`
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `x = (-50 + y) + (y + 1) = -50 + 2y + 1`
   - `y = <initial value> + 2`
3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `x = (-50 + 2y + 1) + (y + 2) = -50 + 3y + 3`
   - `y = <initial value> + 3`
4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `x = (-50 + 3y + 3) + (y + 3) = -50 + 4y + 6`
   - `y = <initial value> + 4`
5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `x = (-50 + 4y + 6) + (y + 4) = -50 + 5y + 10`
   - `y = <initial value> + 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The loop terminates when `x` becomes non-negative. The exact value of `y` and `x` at termination depends on the initial value of `y`. 

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:** The goal is to prove that `y > 0` after the loop terminates.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO**: The verification goal `y > 0` is only guaranteed to be true at termination, not during iterations. During iterations, `y` can be equal to 0 or negative if it starts as such.

**Modification to create a valid invariant:**
- A suitable invariant could be `y >= <initial value> + n` where `n` is the number of iterations completed. This ensures that `y` is incremented with each iteration, maintaining a non-negative value.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration, `y >= <initial value> + n` where `n` is the number of iterations completed.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant holds because `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, ensuring that it is always greater than or equal to its initial value plus the number of iterations completed.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment of the Invariant:**
- Before the loop begins, `n = 0` and `y` is at its initial value. Thus, the invariant `y >= <initial value> + 0` holds true.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation of the Invariant:**
- If the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (i.e., `y >= <initial value> + n`), after executing the loop body:
  - `y` is incremented by 1, thus `y >= <initial value> + n + 1`.
- Therefore, the invariant is preserved.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables at Termination:**
- The loop terminates when `x >= 0`. At this point, `y` has been incremented `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations. Thus, `y` will be `initial value + n`.

**Validity of the Invariant at Termination:**
- Since `n` is the number of iterations, and if `y` was initially non-negative, `y` will be greater than `0` when the loop terminates.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
- The post-condition `assert y > 0;` is correct if the initial value of `y` is greater than `0`. If `y` starts at `0` or less, the loop may not execute enough times to ensure `y` is greater than `0`.

**Proving the Post-condition:**
- When the loop terminates, if `y` has been incremented sufficiently, and given the invariant holds, `y` will be greater than `0` when the loop exits. Thus, the invariant and the negation of the loop condition ensure that the post-condition is met.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

2025-12-24 00:32:51,887 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant:** The invariant `x + 50 >= 0` fails to hold after each iteration. Initially, `x` is set to -50, which makes the invariant false at the start. After each iteration, `x` is incremented by `y`, but since `y` can start from a value less than or equal to 0, the invariant may not be preserved. This indicates that the invariant does not account for the changes to `x` and `y` appropriately.

2. **Goal Assertion:** The assertion `/*@ assert y > 0; */` cannot be verified because the invariant does not provide sufficient information to guarantee that `y` will be greater than 0 when the loop terminates. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be implied when the loop condition becomes false.

To address these issues, the loop invariant must be redefined to ensure it holds at the start, remains valid after each iteration, and supports the assertion after the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:
```c
void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
        /*@
        loop invariant y == \at(y, Pre) + \counter;
        loop invariant x + 50 + (y - \at(y, Pre)) * \counter >= 0;
        loop invariant y > 0;
        loop assigns x, y;
        */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }
```

#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The purpose of the loop is to increment the variable `x` by the value of `y` until `x` is no longer less than zero. This effectively increases `x` from its initial value of -50 by adding increasing values of `y`, which starts at the input value `y` and increments by 1 in each iteration.

- **Structure**: 
  - The governing condition of the loop is `while (x < 0)`. The loop continues as long as `x` is negative.
  - In each iteration, the body of the loop performs two operations:
    1. `x = x + y;` - This updates `x` by adding the current value of `y`.
    2. `y = y + 1;` - This increments `y` by 1.
  - The relevant variables are `x`, which starts at -50, and `y`, which starts at the input value.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Before the loop begins:
    - `x = -50`
    - `y = <input_value>`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After iteration 1:
    - `x = -50 + <input_value>` 
    - `y = <input_value> + 1`
  - After iteration 2:
    - `x = -50 + <input_value> + (<input_value> + 1)`
    - `y = <input_value> + 2`
  - After iteration 3:
    - `x = -50 + 3 * <input_value> + 3`
    - `y = <input_value> + 3`
  - After iteration 4:
    - `x = -50 + 4 * <input_value> + 6`
    - `y = <input_value> + 4`
  - After iteration 5:
    - `x = -50 + 5 * <input_value> + 10`
    - `y = <input_value> + 5`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**: 
  - The loop terminates when `x` is no longer less than 0, which will happen when `x` becomes non-negative after sufficient iterations.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The goal is to show that `y > 0` after the loop terminates.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **NO**: The verification goal `y > 0` is only true at termination, not during iterations since `y` starts from the input value and increments in each iteration.

- **Modification for Invariant**: 
  - We can modify the verification goal to `y >= <input_value>` which holds true at the start and remains true throughout the iterations. This is because `y` starts at the input value and only increases.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: At the beginning and end of every loop iteration, `y >= <input_value>` and `x + 50 + (n * (n + 1) / 2) = (n * <input_value>)` where `n` is the number of iterations.

- **Validity Explanation**: 
  - The invariant holds because `y` starts at the input value and only increases, thus `y >= <input_value>` is always true. The relation involving `x` ensures that we keep track of how much `x` has increased relative to its initial state.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment Explanation**: 
  - Before the first iteration, `y` is equal to the input value, thus `y >= <input_value>` holds true. The loop invariant is established at the start of the loop.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation Explanation**: 
  - If `y >= <input_value>` holds at the start of an iteration, it remains true after `y` is incremented by 1 in the loop body. The loop condition `x < 0` ensures that `x` is updated correctly, maintaining the relationship that defines our invariant.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State at Termination**: 
  - The loop terminates when `x >= 0`, which means that the cumulative additions to `x` from `y` have reached or exceeded 50. At this point, `y` will have been incremented several times, ensuring that `y > 0`.

- **Invariant Validity**: 
  - At termination, since `x` is no longer less than 0 and `y` has been incremented, the invariant remains valid.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Post-condition Evaluation**: 
  - The post-condition `assert y > 0;` is correct because `y` starts at an input value and increments in every iteration, ensuring it will always be greater than 0 when the loop exits.

- **Invariant and Negation of Loop Condition**: 
  - The invariant `y >= <input_value>` combined with the fact that the loop terminates when `x` is no longer less than 0 (meaning sufficient iterations have occurred) guarantees that `y` must be greater than 0, thus validating the post-condition.

- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_y ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }`

2025-12-24 00:42:13,748 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo84` is to repeatedly modify the variables `x` and `y` until `x` is no longer less than 0. The loop will increase `x` by the value of `y` and increment `y` by 1 during each iteration. The intended outcome is to ensure that after the loop completes, `x` becomes non-negative, and `y` is incremented sufficiently to meet the post-condition.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues as long as `x < 0`.
- **Operations in the Body:**
  - `x = x + y;` - This operation adds the current value of `y` to `x`.
  - `y = y + 1;` - This operation increments `y` by 1.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: Initialized to -50, it accumulates the sum of `y` values over iterations.
  - `y`: A parameter that starts with an initial value and is incremented with each iteration.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop begins:
  - `x = -50`
  - `y = initial_value` (value passed to the function)

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - `x = -50 + y`
   - `y = initial_value + 1`
   
2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - `x = (-50 + y) + (initial_value + 1) = -50 + 2y + 1`
   - `y = initial_value + 2`
   
3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - `x = (-50 + 2y + 1) + (initial_value + 2) = -50 + 3y + 3`
   - `y = initial_value + 3`
   
4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - `x = (-50 + 3y + 3) + (initial_value + 3) = -50 + 4y + 6`
   - `y = initial_value + 4`
   
5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - `x = (-50 + 4y + 6) + (initial_value + 4) = -50 + 5y + 10`
   - `y = initial_value + 5`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- The loop terminates when `x >= 0`. The exact state will depend on the initial value of `y`. 

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition to prove is `assert y > 0;`.

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as Part of the Loop Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it only holds true at termination and not necessarily during the iterations.

**Modification of the Verification Goal:**
- A suitable invariant could be `y > initial_value` or `y > 0` after sufficient iterations. This implies that `y` will always be greater than its initial value.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`y > initial_value` (where `initial_value` is the value of `y` at the start of the function).

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant is valid because:
- It holds true at the beginning since `y` is initialized to `initial_value`.
- It is preserved through iterations since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- It will also hold when the loop terminates because `y` will have been incremented multiple times.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment of Invariant:**
The invariant `y > initial_value` is established as follows:
- At the start of the loop, `y` is equal to `initial_value`, thus `y` is not less than `initial_value`.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation of Invariant:**
- If `y > initial_value` holds at the beginning of an iteration, then after executing `y = y + 1`, `y` will be at least `initial_value + 1`, thus preserving the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State at Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `x >= 0` and `y` has been incremented several times. Therefore, `y` will be greater than `initial_value`.

**Validity of Invariant at Termination:**
The invariant `y > initial_value` remains valid at termination since `y` continues to be incremented while `x` is being updated.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of Post-condition:**
The post-condition `assert y > 0;` is correct if `initial_value` is greater than 0. 

**How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
- The invariant `y > initial_value` combined with the termination condition (when `x >= 0`) ensures that `y` has been incremented enough times. If `initial_value` is positive, `y` will also be positive, thus satisfying the post-condition. If `initial_value` is non-positive, further analysis of the number of iterations needed for `x` to become non-negative would be necessary to validate the post-condition fully.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.



Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_y ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }`

2025-12-24 00:42:13,771 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(x == -50) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `

void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
        /* >>> LOOP INVARIANT TO FILL <<< */
        
            /*@
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_y ;
          loop invariant  PLACE_HOLDER_x ;
            */

      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }

2025-12-24 00:47:00,103 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:
The first error indicates that the loop invariant `x + 50 >= 0` does not remain valid after each iteration of the loop. Since `x` is initialized to -50 and is incremented by `y` during each iteration, this invariant is insufficient to ensure that `x` remains non-negative after the updates. 

The second error states that the assertion `/*@ assert y > 0; */` cannot be verified with the current invariant. The invariant must be strengthened to ensure that when the loop terminates, it implies that `y` is greater than 0. Given that `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that the invariant reflects this relationship.

To address both errors, we will regenerate the loop invariant to ensure it holds true at the start, remains valid through iterations, and supports the post-condition.

### Fixed C Code:
```c
void foo84(int y) {

    int x = -50;
  
    
    
            
        /*@
          loop invariant x >= -50;
          loop invariant y >= \at(y, Pre);
          loop invariant y > 0;
            */
            while (x < 0) {
      
      x  = x + y;
      y  = y + 1;
      
  
    }
            
    /*@ assert y > 0; */
  
  }
```
