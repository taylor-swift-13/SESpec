2025-12-27 04:48:14,106 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo76` is to increment the variable `c` and consequently update the variable `z` until a certain condition (determined by the function `unknown()`) is no longer satisfied. The loop aims to ensure that `c` does not exceed 36 while incrementing `z` from its initial value, which is derived from the input parameter `y`.

The loop's structure consists of a `while` loop that continues as long as the `unknown()` function returns true. Inside the loop body, there is a conditional statement that checks if `c` is less than 36. If this condition is satisfied, both `c` and `z` are incremented by 1. The variables relevant to the loop's behavior include:
- `c`: a counter initialized to 0, which tracks how many times the loop has executed.
- `z`: initialized to `36 * y`, which is updated in each iteration if `c` is less than 36.
- `y`: an input parameter constrained between 0 and 127, which affects the initial value of `z`.
- The condition from `unknown()`, which determines the continuation of the loop.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `y`: an integer between 0 and 127 (let's assume `y = 1` for this analysis).
- `x1`, `x2`, `x3`: unspecified integers, not directly affecting the loop.
- `c`: initialized to 0.
- `z`: calculated as `36 * y = 36 * 1 = 36`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `unknown()` is true and `c < 36`, then:
   - `c = 1`, `z = 37`.

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - If `unknown()` is still true and `c < 36`, then:
   - `c = 2`, `z = 38`.

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - If `unknown()` is still true and `c < 36`, then:
   - `c = 3`, `z = 39`.

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - If `unknown()` is still true and `c < 36`, then:
   - `c = 4`, `z = 40`.

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - If `unknown()` is still true and `c < 36`, then:
   - `c = 5`, `z = 41`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates after 5 iterations (e.g., `unknown()` returns false), then:
   - `c = 5`, `z = 41`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition to verify is ` ( z < 0 && z >= 4608 ) ==> ( c >= 36 ); `

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it is only true at termination and does not hold during the iterations. Specifically, `z` cannot be both less than 0 and greater than or equal to 4608 at the same time, making the implication trivially true.

**Modification of the Verification Goal:**
To create a valid invariant, we can focus on the relationship between `c` and `z` as the loop progresses. A potential modified invariant could be:
- `c <= 36` and `z == 36 + c`.

**Establishment:**
- Before the loop starts, `c = 0` and `z = 36`, so the modified invariant holds.

**Preservation:**
- If `c < 36`, after one iteration, `c` increments to `c + 1`, and `z` increments to `z + 1`. Thus, `z == 36 + c` still holds.

**Termination:**
- When the loop terminates, if `c < 36` is false, then `c` must be 36, which leads to `z = 36 + 36 = 72`. This means the invariant is still valid.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- `c <= 36` and `z == 36 + c`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant holds true because:
1. **Establishment**: Initially, `c = 0` and `z = 36`, so `z == 36 + c` is true.
2. **Preservation**: If `c < 36` is true, then in the next iteration, `c` becomes `c + 1` and `z` becomes `z + 1`, maintaining the relationship `z == 36 + c`.
3. **Termination**: When the loop ends, `c` must be equal to 36, leading to `z = 72`, which satisfies the invariant.

### e. Establishment

The proposed invariant `c <= 36` and `z == 36 + c` is established because:
- The pre-condition `0 <= y <= 127` ensures that `z` starts at `36 * y`, and when `y = 1`, `z = 36`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `c = 0` and `z = 36`, fulfilling the invariant.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved through each iteration because:
- If `c < 36` holds at the beginning of an iteration, then both `c` and `z` are incremented by 1. Thus, after the increment, `z` will equal `36 + (c + 1)`, which maintains the relationship required by the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, the relevant state of variables is:
- If `unknown()` returns false, we cannot determine the exact value of `c`, but we know it must be at most 36. The invariant `c <= 36` holds true. The invariant also ensures that if the loop exits, `c` must have reached its maximum value of 36, leading to `z` being `72`, which does not contradict the invariant.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition ` ( z < 0 && z >= 4608 ) ==> ( c >= 36 ); ` is **not correct**. The invariant shows that `z` cannot be less than 0, and thus the left-hand side of the implication is never true, making the entire implication vacuously true.

**Conclusion:**
The loop invariant `c <= 36` and `z == 36 + c` ensures that the relationship between `c` and `z` is maintained throughout the loop iterations, and when the loop terminates, the conditions imply the post-condition is satisfied, even if the post-condition itself is trivially true.

Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not modify any existing annotations or add new annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders `PLACE_HOLDER` before loop.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to fill `PLACE_HOLDER` for `loop invariant` and `loop assigns`, do not generate any `requires` or `ensures` or `loop variant`.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `0 <= \at(y,Pre) && \at(y,Pre) <= 127 && (z == 36 * \at(y,Pre)) * (c == 0) * (x3 == \at(x3,Pre)) * (x2 == \at(x2,Pre)) * (x1 == \at(x1,Pre)) * (y == \at(y,Pre))`

Loop program: `


/*@
    requires 0 <= y && y <= 127;
    */
    
void foo76(int y,int x1,int x2,int x3) {
  int c = 0;
  int z = 36 * y;
