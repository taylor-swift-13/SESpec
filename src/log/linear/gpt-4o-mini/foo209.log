#### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

- **Purpose**: The purpose of the loop is to repeatedly increment three integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z` as long as the condition provided by `unknown()` is true. The loop's intended outcome is to increase the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` in a controlled manner until the condition becomes false.

- **Structure**: The loop is structured with a `while` statement that checks the condition `unknown()`. Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:
  - `x` is incremented by 1.
  - `y` is incremented by 2.
  - `z` is incremented by 3.
  
  The variables relevant to the loop's behavior are:
  - `x`: starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration.
  - `y`: starts at 0 and increases by 2 with each iteration.
  - `z`: starts at 0 and increases by 3 with each iteration.

#### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling**:
  - Before the loop starts: 
    - `x = 0`
    - `y = 0`
    - `z = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling**:
  - After 1st iteration:
    - `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`
  - After 2nd iteration:
    - `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `z = 6`
  - After 3rd iteration:
    - `x = 3`, `y = 6`, `z = 9`
  - After 4th iteration:
    - `x = 4`, `y = 8`, `z = 12`
  - After 5th iteration:
    - `x = 5`, `y = 10`, `z = 15`

- **Post-Loop Sampling**:
  - If the loop terminates after the 5th iteration, it indicates that `unknown()` has returned false. The final values will depend on how many iterations were executed, but we can say that:
    - `x >= 5`, `y >= 10`, `z >= 15` if the loop ran 5 times.

#### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal**: The provided post-condition is `assert x >= 0;`. 

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**: 
  - **YES**: The goal `x >= 0` can be directly used as an invariant component because `x` starts at 0 and only increases with each iteration, ensuring it remains non-negative throughout the loop's execution.

#### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant**: `x >= 0 && y >= 0 && z >= 0`.

- **Explanation of Validity**: This invariant states that all three variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, are non-negative at the beginning and end of every iteration. Given that all variables start at 0 and are only incremented, this condition holds true throughout the loop.

#### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of Invariant**: Before the first iteration, `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`. Therefore, `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, and `z >= 0` holds true.

- **Pre-condition Guarantee**: The initialization of all three variables to 0 guarantees that the invariant holds before the first iteration begins.

#### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of Invariant**: 
  - Assume the invariant `x >= 0 && y >= 0 && z >= 0` holds at the start of an iteration.
  - The loop condition `unknown()` is true, and the body of the loop executes:
    - `x` is incremented by 1 (thus `x >= 0` remains true).
    - `y` is incremented by 2 (thus `y >= 0` remains true).
    - `z` is incremented by 3 (thus `z >= 0` remains true).
  - Therefore, after the iteration, the invariant still holds.

#### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables at Termination**: When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` is false. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` depend on how many times the loop executed. However, since each variable was only incremented, we can state:
  - `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`, `z >= 0` holds true when the loop terminates.

- **Validity of Invariant at Termination**: The invariant remains valid because it holds true right before the loop condition fails, and thus continues to hold even when the loop ends.

#### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of Post-condition**: The post-condition `assert x >= 0;` is correct.

- **Explanation of Proof**: The invariant `x >= 0` is maintained throughout the loop iterations. When the loop terminates, the invariant is still valid. Since the loop condition is false, we can conclude that `x` remains non-negative, thus fulfilling the post-condition. The invariant, in conjunction with the negation of the loop condition (which indicates that `unknown()` is false), confirms that the post-condition is satisfied.

2025-12-23 23:38:26,309 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The current loop invariant `z == 0 + 3 * (x + y / 2 + z / 3)` fails to hold after each iteration. This is because the way it is formulated does not account for the increments made to `z` during the loop. After each iteration, `z` is incremented by 3, which means the invariant must reflect that `z` will always equal its initial value plus 3 times the number of iterations that have occurred.

2. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `/*@ assert x >= 0; */` cannot be verified because the invariant does not sufficiently ensure that `x` remains non-negative throughout the loop. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that it reflects the changes to `x`, `y`, and `z` in a way that guarantees the postcondition when the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo209() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant x >= 0;
      loop invariant y >= 0;
      loop invariant z >= 0;
      loop invariant z == 3 * (x + y / 2 + z / 3); // z increments by 3 each iteration
      loop assigns x, y, z;
    */
    while(unknown()){
       x = x + 1;
       y = y + 2;
       z = z + 3;
    }

    /*@ assert x >= 0; */
