2025-12-23 23:59:15,823 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the function `foo186` is to repeatedly update the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the value of `x` and the relationships among these variables, until the condition defined by `unknown()` returns false. The intended outcome is likely to manipulate these variables in a way that is dependent on their current values, ultimately ensuring that the post-condition `3 * x >= y` holds when the loop terminates.

The loop's structure is governed by the condition `while(unknown())`, which indicates that the loop will continue executing as long as the function `unknown()` returns true. Within the loop body, there are three branches based on the value of `x`:

1. If `x >= 4`: 
   - `x` is incremented by 1.
   - `y` is incremented by 3.
   - `z` is incremented by 10.
   - `w` is incremented by 10.

2. If `x < 4` and `x >= z` and `w > y`:
   - `x` and `y` are negated.

3. Otherwise:
   - `x` is incremented by 1.
   - `y` is incremented by 2.

The relevant variables are `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, which are all initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- `x = 0`
- `y = 0`
- `z = 0`
- `w = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**

1. **After Iteration 1:**
   - If `unknown()` is true and `x < 4`, then `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes 2 (the third case).
   - Sample: `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

2. **After Iteration 2:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` is still true and `x < 4`, `x` becomes 2 and `y` becomes 4.
   - Sample: `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

3. **After Iteration 3:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` is still true and `x < 4`, `x` becomes 3 and `y` becomes 6.
   - Sample: `x = 3`, `y = 6`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

4. **After Iteration 4:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` is still true and `x < 4`, `x` becomes 4 and `y` becomes 8.
   - Sample: `x = 4`, `y = 8`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

5. **After Iteration 5:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` is still true and `x >= 4`, `x` becomes 5, `y` becomes 11, `z` becomes 10, and `w` becomes 10.
   - Sample: `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates after five iterations, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` will depend on the last executed iteration. Assuming `unknown()` eventually returns false, we might have:
  - Sample: `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

The verification goal is the assertion `3 * x >= y`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO**: The verification goal `3 * x >= y` is not guaranteed to hold true during all iterations of the loop. It is only necessary that it holds when the loop terminates, not necessarily during the iterations.

- **Modification for a valid invariant:**
  - A possible invariant could be `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`, since `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are initialized to 0 and can only increase or remain non-negative through the loop.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
- `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
- This invariant is valid because:
  - At the start of the loop, all variables are initialized to 0, satisfying `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.
  - Each operation within the loop either increments `x` and `y` or negates them (which does not occur until certain conditions are met). Thus, `x` and `y` remain non-negative throughout the iterations.

### e. Establishment

The invariant `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` is established because:
- Before the first iteration, both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, which satisfies the condition of the invariant.

### f. Preservation

The invariant is preserved as follows:
- In the first case (`x >= 4`), both `x` and `y` are incremented, maintaining non-negativity.
- In the second case (`x < 4` and `x >= z` and `w > y`), `x` and `y` are negated. However, this only occurs when `x` and `y` are both non-negative, thus they remain non-negative.
- In the last case, both `x` and `y` are incremented again, ensuring they remain non-negative.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` is false. The state of the variables will depend on the last executed iteration. However, since `x` and `y` are never allowed to become negative through the loop, the invariant `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` remains valid.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The provided post-condition `3 * x >= y` must be evaluated:
- Given the invariant `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`, it is possible for `3 * x` to be greater than or equal to `y` depending on the final values of `x` and `y`.
- The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (indicating that the loop has terminated), must imply that `3 * x >= y`. If `x` is sufficiently large relative to `y`, the post-condition can be satisfied.

Thus, while the invariant does not directly imply the post-condition, it establishes a foundation that can lead to satisfying the post-condition under the right circumstances. Further analysis may be required to determine the exact relationship between `x` and `y` as the loop progresses.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-23 23:59:15,851 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

- Generate loop invariants with equality constraints as comprehensively as possible.
- Please first try to directly use the verification goal as the loop invariant at `PLACE_HOLDER_VERFICATION_GOAL`. Often, the verification goal (assertion) also holds throughout the loop; in that case, it can be used directly as the invariant.


Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `


void foo186() {

    int x;

2025-12-23 23:59:58,977 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 0)**:
   - The invariant `x >= 0` fails preservation because `x` can be negated in the second branch of the loop (`x = 0 - x;`). This can lead to `x` becoming negative, which violates the invariant. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to account for the possible negation of `x`.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0)**:
   - Similar to `x`, the invariant `y >= 0` also fails preservation for the same reason. When `y` is negated in the second branch of the loop (`y = 0 - y;`), it can also become negative. Thus, this invariant needs to be modified to ensure it remains valid throughout the loop iterations.

3. **Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**:
   - The assertion `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified because the invariants do not sufficiently constrain the relationship between `x` and `y` during the loop. The invariants must be strengthened to ensure that this relationship holds when the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:

```c

2025-12-24 00:14:27,457 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the `foo186` function is to manipulate the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions determined by the value of `x` and the other variables. The loop continues executing as long as the `unknown()` function returns true, which indicates that the loop's execution is dependent on an external condition that is not defined in the provided code.

The loop structure consists of a `while` loop with the condition `unknown()`. Inside the loop body, there are three distinct branches based on the value of `x`:

1. If `x >= 4`, the loop increments `x` by 1, `y` by 3, `z` by 10, and `w` by 10.
2. If `x < 4` and `x >= z` and `w > y`, it negates the values of `x` and `y`.
3. Otherwise, it increments `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.

The variables relevant to the loop's behavior are `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, which are all initialized to 0 before the loop begins.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

- **Pre-Loop Sampling:**
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

- **Post-Iteration Sampling:**
  1. **After Iteration 1:** 
     - If `unknown()` returns true and `x < 4`, then `x` becomes `1`, `y` becomes `2`, `z` remains `0`, `w` remains `0`.
  2. **After Iteration 2:** 
     - If `unknown()` continues to return true and `x < 4`, then `x` becomes `2`, `y` becomes `4`, `z` remains `0`, `w` remains `0`.
  3. **After Iteration 3:** 
     - If `unknown()` continues to return true and `x < 4`, then `x` becomes `3`, `y` becomes `6`, `z` remains `0`, `w` remains `0`.
  4. **After Iteration 4:** 
     - If `unknown()` continues to return true and `x < 4`, then `x` becomes `4`, `y` becomes `8`, `z` remains `0`, `w` remains `0`.
  5. **After Iteration 5:** 
     - If `unknown()` continues to return true and `x >= 4`, then `x` becomes `5`, `y` becomes `11`, `z` becomes `10`, `w` becomes `10`.

- **Post-Loop Sampling:** 
  - If the loop terminates after the fifth iteration, we would have:
    - `x = 5`
    - `y = 11`
    - `z = 10`
    - `w = 10`

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

- **Verification Goal:** The post-condition to be proven is `3 * x >= y`.

- **Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
  - **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant directly because it is only guaranteed to be true at termination and not necessarily during each iteration of the loop.

- **Modification of the verification goal:**
  - A suitable modification could be to propose a loop invariant such as `3 * x >= y` is maintained throughout the loop. However, we need to ensure that this holds before the first iteration, during iterations, and at termination.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

- **Proposed Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration, the invariant `3 * x >= y` holds true.

- **Explanation of Validity:**
  - Before the loop starts, `x = 0` and `y = 0`, so `3 * 0 >= 0` holds true.
  - During the iterations, the changes to `x` and `y` can be tracked:
    - When `x < 4`, `y` is incremented by 2 while `x` is incremented by 1, maintaining the invariant.
    - When `x >= 4`, `y` is incremented by 3 while `x` is incremented by 1, still maintaining the invariant.

### e. Establishment

- **Establishment of the Invariant:**
  - The invariant `3 * x >= y` is established before the first iteration because both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, satisfying `3 * 0 >= 0`.

### f. Preservation

- **Preservation of the Invariant:**
  - If `3 * x >= y` holds at the start of an iteration:
    - In the first case (`x >= 4`), `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` by 3, thus `3 * (x + 1) >= (y + 3)` holds.
    - In the second case (`x < 4` and `x >= z` and `w > y`), negating `x` and `y` could violate the invariant but would need to be analyzed carefully based on the values of `z` and `w`.
    - In the last case, both `x` and `y` are incremented, maintaining the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

- **State of Variables on Termination:**
  - When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` becomes false. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` at termination depend on the path taken through the loop but must satisfy the invariant.

- **Validity of the Invariant at Termination:**
  - Since the invariant holds throughout the iterations, it remains valid at termination, ensuring that `3 * x >= y` is satisfied when the loop condition fails.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

- **Evaluation of the Post-condition:**
  - The post-condition `3 * x >= y` is indeed correct as it is part of our loop invariant.

- **How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
  - The loop invariant `3 * x >= y` combined with the negation of the loop condition (indicating that the loop has finished executing) confirms that the post-condition is met at the end of the function execution. 

This analysis comprehensively addresses the behavior of the loop, the variables involved, and the necessary conditions for establishing, preserving, and verifying the loop invariant and post-condition.

2025-12-24 00:14:27,483 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `

    int x;

2025-12-24 00:15:08,515 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 0):**
   - The invariant `x >= 0` fails to hold after the iteration when `x` is negated in the case where `x >= z && w > y`. If `x` is positive before this operation, negating it would make it negative, violating the invariant. Therefore, this invariant is not preserved through all possible iterations of the loop.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0):**
   - Similarly, the invariant `y >= 0` also fails to hold after the iteration when `y` is negated in the same case (`x >= z && w > y`). If `y` is positive before this operation, negating it would make it negative, violating the invariant. Thus, this invariant is also not preserved.

3. **Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y):**
   - The post-condition `3 * x >= y` cannot be derived from the existing invariants. The current invariants do not provide sufficient constraints to ensure that the post-condition holds after the loop terminates. The invariants need to be strengthened to ensure that the combination of the invariant and the negation of the loop condition can imply the post-condition.

2025-12-24 00:18:57,509 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 3):**
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 3` fails to hold after the iteration when `x` is negated in the case where `x >= z && w > y`. In this case, if `y` is positive before the negation, it can become negative while `x` is also negative, thus violating the invariant. Additionally, the increment of `y` by 3 or 2 in other branches can lead to situations where `y` exceeds `3 * x + 3`.

2. **Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y):**
   - The post-condition `3 * x >= y` cannot be derived from the existing invariants. The current invariants do not provide sufficient constraints to ensure that the post-condition holds after the loop terminates. The invariants need to be strengthened to ensure that the combination of the invariant and the negation of the loop condition can imply the post-condition.

To resolve these issues, we need to regenerate the loop invariants to better reflect the relationships between `x` and `y` throughout the loop iterations.

2025-12-24 00:31:58,995 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

The purpose of the loop in the `foo186` function is to perform a series of operations on the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on the value of `x` and the results of the `unknown()` function, which determines whether the loop continues. The intended outcome is to modify the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` according to certain conditions until the loop terminates.

The loop's governing condition is `while(unknown())`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as the `unknown()` function returns true. Inside the loop, there are three branches:

1. If `x >= 4`, it increments `x` by 1, `y` by 3, `z` by 10, and `w` by 10.
2. If `x < 4` and `x >= z` and `w > y`, it negates the values of `x` and `y`.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it increments `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.

The relevant variables are:
- `x`: a counter that influences the behavior of the loop.
- `y`, `z`, `w`: variables that are modified based on the value of `x`.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **Iteration 1:**
   - Since `x < 4`, `x` becomes `1` and `y` becomes `2`.
   - New values: `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

2. **Iteration 2:**
   - Again, `x < 4`, so `x` becomes `2` and `y` becomes `4`.
   - New values: `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

3. **Iteration 3:**
   - Still `x < 4`, so `x` becomes `3` and `y` becomes `6`.
   - New values: `x = 3`, `y = 6`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

4. **Iteration 4:**
   - Again `x < 4`, so `x` becomes `4` and `y` becomes `8`.
   - New values: `x = 4`, `y = 8`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

5. **Iteration 5:**
   - Now `x >= 4`, so `x` becomes `5`, `y` becomes `11`, `z` becomes `10`, and `w` becomes `10`.
   - New values: `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop condition becomes false after iteration 5, we will not have a specific final state since `unknown()` is not defined. However, we can analyze that the last state before termination will depend on the behavior of `unknown()`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition to be proven is `3 * x >= y`.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO**: The verification goal cannot be used as an invariant because it may not hold true during iterations. It is only guaranteed to hold true at termination.

**Modification for a valid invariant:**
We can propose a modified invariant:
- `3 * x >= y + k` for some integer `k` that is adjusted based on the operations performed.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`3 * x >= y`.

**Validity Explanation:**
- At the start, `x = 0` and `y = 0`, thus `3 * 0 >= 0` holds true.
- After each iteration, we can analyze the changes:
  - If `x >= 4`, `y` increases more slowly than `x` (specifically, `y` increases by 3 while `x` increases by 1).
  - If `x < 4`, `y` increases by 2 while `x` increases by 1.
- In all cases, we can verify that `3 * x` grows faster than `y`, preserving the invariant.

### e. Establishment

The invariant `3 * x >= y` is established because before the first iteration, both `x` and `y` are initialized to `0`, satisfying the condition `3 * 0 >= 0`.

### f. Preservation

To show preservation:
- If `3 * x >= y` holds at the start of an iteration:
  - If `x >= 4`, then `x` becomes `x + 1` and `y` becomes `y + 3`, leading to `3 * (x + 1) >= (y + 3)` simplifying to `3 * x + 3 >= y + 3`, which is true since `3 * x >= y`.
  - If `x < 4` and the second condition holds, `x` becomes `-x` and `y` becomes `-y`, which preserves the invariant.
  - If neither condition holds, `x` increases by 1 and `y` by 2, maintaining the invariant.

### g. Termination Analysis

When the loop terminates, `unknown()` is false. The state of the variables can vary depending on the number of iterations. However, since `3 * x >= y` holds true at the end of the loop and the loop condition is false, the invariant remains valid.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

The post-condition `3 * x >= y` is indeed correct if the invariant holds true at termination. The invariant, combined with the negation of the loop condition (which indicates that the loop has finished executing), guarantees that the post-condition is met because the invariant was maintained throughout the loop iterations.

2025-12-24 00:31:59,027 - DEBUG  - ### Role: ###
You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.





Consider the following C loop:

Pre-condition: `(w == 0) * (z == 0) * (y == 0) * (x == 0)`

Loop program: `

    int x;

2025-12-24 00:36:25,674 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors reported indicate that both the loop invariant and the assertion are fundamentally flawed. 

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 3` does not hold after every iteration. Specifically, when `x` is incremented or negated, the relationship between `y` and `x` can break this invariant. For example, when `x` is incremented, `y` can increase more rapidly than `x`, violating the invariant.

2. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current loop invariant. The invariant needs to ensure that, when combined with the negation of the loop condition, it can imply the post-condition. This means we need a stronger relationship between `y` and `x` that holds through all possible iterations.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we need to establish a relationship that accounts for the maximum potential growth of `y` in relation to `x`. A suitable invariant would be `y <= 3 * x`, ensuring that `y` does not exceed three times the value of `x` throughout the loop, and it should also account for the increments to `y` in the loop.

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo186() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;
    w = 0;

    /*@
      loop invariant z >= 0;
      loop invariant w >= 0;
      loop invariant y <= 3 * x; // Regenerated invariant to ensure preservation and implication

2025-12-24 00:38:09,559 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The reported errors indicate that both the loop invariant and the assertion are fundamentally flawed.

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant**: The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 3` does not hold after every iteration. When `x` is incremented, `y` can increase by 3, leading to situations where `y` exceeds `3 * x + 3`, especially when `x` is less than 4. Additionally, when `x` is negated, the relationship between `y` and `x` can also break the invariant.

2. **Goal Assertion**: The assertion `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current loop invariant. The invariant needs to ensure that, when combined with the negation of the loop condition, it can imply the post-condition. This means we need a stronger relationship between `y` and `x` that holds through all possible iterations.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we need to establish a relationship that accounts for the maximum potential growth of `y` in relation to `x`. A suitable invariant would be to ensure that `y` is bounded by a multiple of `x` that reflects the possible increments to `y` in the loop.

2025-12-24 00:41:45,561 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors reported indicate that both the loop invariant and the assertion are fundamentally flawed.

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant for `y <= 3 * x + 3`**: This invariant fails because it does not account for the potential growth of `y` relative to `x` during iterations. Specifically, when `x >= 4`, `y` increases by 3 while `x` only increases by 1, which can lead to situations where `y` exceeds `3 * x + 3`. Therefore, this invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure it holds true after every iteration.

2. **Goal Assertion for `3 * x >= y`**: The assertion cannot be verified with the current loop invariant because it does not provide a strong enough relationship between `x` and `y`. We need to ensure that `y` is always bounded by a value that reflects its maximum possible growth relative to `x`.

To regenerate the loop invariant, we need to ensure that `y` is bounded by a multiple of `x` that accounts for the increments made in the loop. A suitable modification could be to ensure that `y` does not exceed `3 * x` throughout the loop. Additionally, we need to ensure that `z` and `w` are also properly constrained.

2025-12-24 00:43:31,172 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

The errors reported indicate that both the loop invariant and the assertion are fundamentally flawed.

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant for `y <= 3 * x + 3`**: This invariant does not hold after every iteration due to the way `y` is updated in relation to `x`. When `x` is incremented (especially when `x >= 4`), `y` can increase by 3 while `x` only increases by 1, leading to situations where `y` exceeds `3 * x + 3`. Thus, this invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure it holds true after each iteration.

2. **Goal Assertion for `3 * x >= y`**: The assertion cannot be verified with the current loop invariant because it does not provide a strong enough relationship between `x` and `y`. The invariant must ensure that, when combined with the negation of the loop condition, it can imply the post-condition. 

To regenerate the loop invariant, we need to ensure that `y` is bounded by a multiple of `x` that reflects its maximum possible growth during the iterations. A suitable modification could be to ensure that `y` does not exceed `3 * x`, which would maintain the relationship necessary to satisfy the post-condition.

2025-12-24 00:48:02,182 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome:**
The purpose of the loop in the function `foo186` is to repeatedly update the values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` based on certain conditions that depend on their current values. The loop will continue executing as long as the `unknown()` function returns true. The intended outcome is to manipulate these variables in such a way that certain relationships between them are maintained or altered according to the conditions specified in the loop body.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues executing while `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:**
  - If `x >= 4`, then:
    - `x` is incremented by 1,
    - `y` is incremented by 3,
    - `z` is incremented by 10,
    - `w` is incremented by 10.
  - Else if `x >= z` and `w > y`, then:
    - `x` and `y` are negated.
  - Else:
    - `x` is incremented by 1,
    - `y` is incremented by 2.
  
**Relevant Variables:**
- `x`: A counter that can be incremented or negated based on conditions.
- `y`: Another counter that is modified based on the conditions involving `x`.
- `z`: A variable that appears to act as a threshold for comparisons with `x`.
- `w`: A variable that is compared with `y` and affects how `x` and `y` are modified.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Before the loop starts:
  - `x = 0`
  - `y = 0`
  - `z = 0`
  - `w = 0`

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After 1st Iteration:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` returns true and `x < 4`:
     - `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`
2. **After 2nd Iteration:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` returns true and `x < 4`:
     - `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`
3. **After 3rd Iteration:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` returns true and `x < 4`:
     - `x = 3`, `y = 6`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`
4. **After 4th Iteration:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` returns true and `x < 4`:
     - `x = 4`, `y = 8`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`
5. **After 5th Iteration:**
   - Assuming `unknown()` returns true and `x >= 4`:
     - `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If `unknown()` returns false, the loop exits, and let's assume `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition to be proven is `3 * x >= y`.

**Can the verification goal serve as part of the loop invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to hold at termination, not necessarily during the iterations.

**Modification for a Valid Invariant:**
To create a valid invariant, we can modify the verification goal to express a relationship that holds throughout the loop. A suitable invariant could be:
- `3 * x >= y` or `y <= 3 * x`.

**Establishment:**
Before the loop starts:
- `3 * x = 3 * 0 = 0`
- `y = 0`
- Thus, `0 >= 0` holds true.

**Preservation:**
We need to show that if `3 * x >= y` holds at the beginning of an iteration, it still holds after the iteration. 

1. **If `x >= 4`:**
   - `x` increases by 1, `y` increases by 3.
   - New values: `x' = x + 1`, `y' = y + 3`.
   - Check: `3 * (x + 1) >= (y + 3)` simplifies to `3 * x + 3 >= y + 3` or `3 * x >= y`, which is preserved.

2. **If `x >= z` and `w > y`:**
   - Both `x` and `y` are negated.
   - New values: `x' = -x`, `y' = -y`.
   - Check: `3 * (-x) >= -y` translates to `-3 * x >= -y`, which implies `3 * x <= y`. This does not preserve the invariant.

3. **Else case:**
   - `x` increases by 1, `y` increases by 2.
   - New values: `x' = x + 1`, `y' = y + 2`.
   - Check: `3 * (x + 1) >= (y + 2)` simplifies to `3 * x + 3 >= y + 2`, or `3 * x >= y - 1`, which may not hold.

Thus, we can refine our invariant to `y <= 3 * x + k` for some small integer `k` based on the modifications.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`y <= 3 * x + 1`.

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant can be maintained across iterations as it allows for a small margin (`+1`) to account for the increments of `y` relative to `x`. 

### e. Establishment

**How the Proposed Invariant is Established:**
At the start of the loop:
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
- Thus, `0 <= 3 * 0 + 1` holds true, establishing the invariant.

### f. Preservation

**How the Invariant is Preserved:**
1. **If `x >= 4`:**
   - After the update, `y` increases by 3 and `x` by 1. The relationship `y <= 3 * x + 1` holds because both sides are incremented proportionally.

2. **If `x >= z` and `w > y`:**
   - Negating both values can break the invariant, thus care must be taken in this condition.

3. **Else case:**
   - `x` increases by 1, `y` by 2. The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 1` still holds due to the nature of the increments.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**
When the loop terminates, the condition `unknown()` returns false. The final values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` can vary but must satisfy the invariant `y <= 3 * x + 1`.

**Why the Invariant Remains Valid:**
Even if `unknown()` is false, the last iteration must have maintained the invariant. Thus, the relationship between `y` and `x` holds true at termination.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Evaluation of the Provided Post-condition:**
The post-condition `3 * x >= y` is correct under the established invariant.

**How the Invariant Proves the Post-condition:**
The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 1` combined with the negation of the loop condition (which means the loop has ended) implies that `y` is bounded by a small margin from `3 * x`. Thus, as the loop terminates, it guarantees that `3 * x` is indeed greater than or equal to `y`, fulfilling the post-condition.

You are a helpful AI software assistant specializing in reasoning about code behavior. Your task is to analyze C programs and identify loop invariants that can be used to verify program properties using Frama-C.

### Task: ###
Given a C program with a loop, generate the necessary loop invariants in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations. These invariants will help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program.



Inputs:
- The pre-condition before the loop begins execution.
- A full C loop program with invariant annotations containing `PLACE_HOLDER` that need to be filled.

### Output: ###
Provide the complete C code with the loop invariant and other relevant ACSL annotations, where all placeholders are correctly filled in ```c ```.

### Rules: ###
- If you break any of these rules, my family will disown me.
- Do not use `\at(var, LoopEntry)` to refer to the value of a variable at the start of the loop. Instead, use the value specified in the pre-condition.
- Do not modify any existing annotations. You are only allowed to replace the placeholders PLACE_HOLDER_TO_FILL before loop.
- Do not generate loop variant.
- Only use keywords and constructs supported in ACSL annotations for loops.
- Do not generate any natural language explanations after ACSL annotations.
- When `unknown()` used as the loop condition, the number of loop iterations can be any non-negative integer, and the invariant must hold for all cases.
- You are only allowed to generate loop invariant and loop assigns, do not generate any requirements and ensurements.

2025-12-24 00:48:41,368 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 0)**:
   - The invariant `x >= 0` fails to hold after iterations where `x` can be negated. In the case where `x >= z` and `w > y`, `x` is set to `0 - x`, which could result in `x` becoming negative. Therefore, this invariant is not preserved.

2. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0)**:
   - Similar to `x`, the invariant `y >= 0` fails because when `x >= z` and `w > y`, `y` is set to `0 - y`, which can also lead to `y` becoming negative. Thus, this invariant also does not hold after certain iterations.

3. **Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**:
   - The assertion `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not provide sufficient information to guarantee this relationship holds at the end of the loop. The invariants must be strengthened to ensure that this assertion can be implied when the loop terminates.

2025-12-24 01:00:54,428 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 5)**:
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 5` fails preservation because the loop body can modify `y` in such a way that this relationship is violated. Specifically, when `x >= z` and `w > y`, both `x` and `y` are negated, which can lead to `y` exceeding `3 * x + 5`. Thus, this invariant is not preserved after iterations.

2. **Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**:
   - The assertion `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified because the current invariants do not sufficiently relate `x` and `y` to guarantee this condition at termination. The invariant needs to be strengthened to ensure that it can imply the postcondition when combined with the negation of the loop condition.

To address these issues, we need to regenerate the loop invariant. A suitable invariant should account for the maximum possible increments of `y` and maintain a valid relationship with `x`.

### Proposed Loop Invariant:

1. **New Invariant**: `y <= 3 * x + 6;`
   - This invariant allows for the maximum increase of `y` that can occur in the loop while ensuring that it remains valid after each iteration. The additional `6` accounts for the maximum increments that can happen when `y` is increased by `3` or `2` in different branches.

2. **Additional Invariants**:
   - `z >= 0;` (remains unchanged)
   - `w >= 0;` (remains unchanged)

### Fixed C Code:

```c
void foo186() {

    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    int w;

    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    z = 0;
    w = 0;

    /*@

2025-12-24 01:03:37,675 - INFO  - think in natural language: ### a. Loop Purpose and Structure

**Purpose and Intended Outcome of the Loop:**
The loop in the function `foo186` is designed to manipulate four integer variables: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The specific goal appears to be to perform operations on these variables based on certain conditions that depend on their current values. The loop continues to execute as long as the function `unknown()` returns true, suggesting that the loop's execution is contingent on some external or unpredictable condition.

**Loop Structure:**
- **Governing Condition:** The loop continues to execute while `unknown()` returns true.
- **Operations in the Loop Body:**
  - If `x >= 4`: Increment `x` by 1, `y` by 3, `z` by 10, and `w` by 10.
  - Else if `x >= z` and `w > y`: Set `x` and `y` to their negative values.
  - Else: Increment `x` by 1 and `y` by 2.
- **Relevant Variables:**
  - `x`: A counter that influences other operations.
  - `y`: Another counter that is incremented or negated based on conditions involving `x`.
  - `z`: A threshold variable that influences the behavior when `x` is compared to it.
  - `w`: A variable that interacts with `y` and influences the negation condition.

### b. Sample and Analyze Variable Values

**Pre-Loop Sampling:**
- Initial values: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

**Post-Iteration Sampling:**
1. **After 1st Iteration:**
   - If `unknown()` returns true, the first condition (`x >= 4`) is false. The last condition executes: `x = 1`, `y = 2`.
   - Values: `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.
  
2. **After 2nd Iteration:**
   - Again, `x < 4`, so the last condition executes: `x = 2`, `y = 4`.
   - Values: `x = 2`, `y = 4`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

3. **After 3rd Iteration:**
   - Still `x < 4`, last condition executes: `x = 3`, `y = 6`.
   - Values: `x = 3`, `y = 6`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

4. **After 4th Iteration:**
   - `x < 4`, last condition executes: `x = 4`, `y = 8`.
   - Values: `x = 4`, `y = 8`, `z = 0`, `w = 0`.

5. **After 5th Iteration:**
   - Now `x >= 4`, first condition executes: `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.
   - Values: `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.

**Post-Loop Sampling:**
- If the loop terminates after the 5th iteration, the final values will depend on the last evaluation of `unknown()`. Assuming it becomes false, we might have `x = 5`, `y = 11`, `z = 10`, `w = 10`.

### c. Verification Goal Analysis

**Verification Goal:**
The post-condition to be proven is `3 * x >= y`.

**Can the Verification Goal Serve as Part of the Loop Invariant?**
- **NO:** The verification goal `3 * x >= y` cannot be used directly as an invariant because it is only guaranteed to be true at termination, not necessarily during each iteration of the loop.

**Modifications to Create a Valid Invariant:**
To create a valid invariant, we can consider the relationship between `x` and `y` during iterations. A potential invariant could be:
- `y <= 2 * x + 1` (since `y` is incremented by 2 or 3, while `x` is incremented by 1).

**Establishment:**
Before the loop starts, `x = 0` and `y = 0`, so `y <= 2 * x + 1` holds true (`0 <= 1`).

**Preservation:**
During each iteration, we can show that if `y <= 2 * x + 1` holds before the iteration, it continues to hold after. 

**Termination:**
When the loop terminates, we can check if `3 * x >= y` holds using the established invariant.

### d. Loop Invariant Discussion

**Proposed Loop Invariant:**
`y <= 2 * x + 1`

**Explanation of Validity:**
This invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop (establishment), is preserved through each iteration (as shown in preservation), and when the loop exits, the relationship between `x` and `y` guarantees that `3 * x >= y` holds true.

### e. Establishment

**Establishment Explanation:**
The invariant `y <= 2 * x + 1` is established because at the beginning of the loop, both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0. Thus, `0 <= 2 * 0 + 1` is true.

### f. Preservation

**Preservation Explanation:**
- If `y <= 2 * x + 1` holds at the start of an iteration:
  - If `x >= 4`: `y` increases by 3 and `x` increases by 1. Therefore, `y` will be less than or equal to `2 * (x + 1) + 1`.
  - If `x >= z` and `w > y`: `y` becomes negative, which does not violate the invariant.
  - If `x < 4`: `y` increases by 2 and `x` increases by 1, thus `y <= 2 * (x + 1) + 1` holds.

### g. Termination Analysis

**State of Variables on Termination:**
When the loop terminates, `unknown()` returns false. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` will depend on the last executed conditions.

**Validity of Invariant on Termination:**
At termination, `y <= 2 * x + 1` will still hold true, which implies `3 * x >= y` can be derived from the invariant.

### h. Post-condition Correctness

**Post-condition Evaluation:**
The post-condition `3 * x >= y` is correct as it is derived from the invariant established.

**Proof of Post-condition:**
When the loop condition is false, the invariant `y <= 2 * x + 1` implies that `3 * x >= y` is satisfied, thus ensuring the correctness of the post-condition.

2025-12-24 01:04:22,336 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 0)**
   - The invariant `x >= 0` fails preservation because when `x` is negated in the second condition of the loop (`x = 0 - x`), `x` can become negative. This invariant must be adjusted to account for the possibility of `x` being negative after this operation.

2. **Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y >= 0)**
   - Similar to `x`, the invariant `y >= 0` is violated when `y` is negated (`y = 0 - y`). This invariant needs to be revised to ensure it remains valid after all possible iterations of the loop.

3. **Error 3: Goal Preservation of Invariant ((x >= 4 ==> (y - 3 * x) >= 0))**
   - This invariant does not hold after the first iteration when `x` is incremented, and `y` is increased by 3. The adjustment should ensure that the relationship between `y` and `x` remains valid throughout the loop's iterations.

4. **Error 4: Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**
   - The postcondition `3 * x >= y` must be strengthened in the invariant to ensure that it can be derived from the invariant and the negation of the loop condition when the loop terminates. This means we need to find a relationship that will always ensure the postcondition is satisfied.

2025-12-24 01:06:13,063 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 2)**
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 2` fails preservation because during the loop, `y` is incremented by either 3 or 2, while `x` is also incremented. When `x` is increased, the relationship defined by the invariant may not hold true after the loop iteration. Specifically, when `x` is incremented, the bound on `y` must be adjusted accordingly to ensure that it remains valid after all possible operations.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**
   - The postcondition `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current invariants. This means that the relationship between `x` and `y` needs to be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be derived from the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition. We need to establish a stronger relationship that captures the increments to `y` and the conditions under which `x` is modified.

2025-12-24 01:08:01,405 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 3)**
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 3` fails preservation because during the loop, `y` can be incremented by 3 or 2, and `x` is also incremented. This means that after the loop's body executes, the relationship defined by this invariant may not hold true, especially if `y` increases more than `3 * x + 3` allows. The invariant needs to be adjusted to account for the maximum possible value of `y` after each iteration.

2. **Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 4 ==> (y <= 3 * x))**
   - This invariant also fails preservation because if `x` is incremented and `y` is increased significantly, `y` may exceed `3 * x` even when `x` is greater than or equal to 4. We need to ensure that this invariant holds true after every possible operation in the loop, particularly when `y` is incremented.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**
   - The postcondition `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current invariants. This means that the relationship between `x` and `y` must be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be derived from the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition. We need to ensure that the invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` in a way that guarantees the postcondition will hold.

2025-12-24 01:13:21,928 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 5)**
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 5` fails preservation because during the loop, `y` can be incremented by 3 or 2, while `x` may only increase by 1. This means that after the loop's body executes, `y` could exceed `3 * x + 5`, especially when `x` is incremented but `y` is increased significantly. We need to adjust this invariant to ensure it remains valid after each iteration, particularly after the increments to `y`.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**
   - The postcondition `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current invariants. This indicates that the relationship between `x` and `y` needs to be strengthened. We need to ensure that the invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` in a way that guarantees the postcondition will hold true when the loop terminates.

### Fixed C Code:

2025-12-24 01:15:18,057 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 5)**
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 5` fails preservation because during the loop, `y` can be incremented by 3 or 2, while `x` is incremented by 1. After the loop's body executes, `y` may exceed `3 * x + 5`, especially when `x` is not sufficiently large to keep up with the increments of `y`. This invariant needs to be adjusted to ensure it remains valid after each iteration, particularly when `y` is incremented.

2. **Error 2: Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**
   - The postcondition `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current invariants. This indicates that the relationship between `x` and `y` needs to be strengthened. We need to ensure that the invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` in a way that guarantees the postcondition will hold true when the loop terminates.

2025-12-24 01:17:05,762 - DEBUG  - ### Error Analysis:

1. **Error 1: Goal Preservation of Invariant (x >= 0)**
   - The invariant `x >= 0` fails preservation because in the second condition of the loop (`x = 0 - x`), `x` can become negative. This invariant must be adjusted to account for the possibility of `x` being negative after this operation. The invariant should reflect the fact that `x` can take negative values when it is negated.

2. **Error 2: Goal Preservation of Invariant (y <= 3 * x + 5)**
   - The invariant `y <= 3 * x + 5` fails preservation because during the loop, `y` can be incremented by 3 or 2, and `x` may not increase sufficiently to maintain this relationship. After the loop's body executes, `y` could exceed `3 * x + 5`. We need to adjust this invariant to ensure it remains valid after each iteration, particularly when `y` is incremented.

3. **Error 3: Goal Assertion (3 * x >= y)**
   - The postcondition `3 * x >= y` cannot be verified with the current invariants. This indicates that the relationship between `x` and `y` needs to be strengthened to ensure that the postcondition can be derived from the invariant combined with the negation of the loop condition. We need to ensure that the invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` in a way that guarantees the postcondition will hold true when the loop terminates.
